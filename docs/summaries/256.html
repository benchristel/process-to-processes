<p>I tried to write a book for programmers about how to make better software. Then I realized that the only way to make software better is to make the world better. So here we are.</p>
<p>Software inhabits a vast system of many interacting parts, including people and machines. Improving the <em>whole system</em> is both the motive and the method for improving software.</p>
<p>To improve a system, we start by removing the friction, waste, and suffering that occur when different parts with <em>mismatched behaviors or interfaces</em> communicate. Examples of mismatches:</p>
<ul>
<li>a bug in software is a mismatch between the software&#39;s behavior and its users&#39; expectations.</li>
<li>when a user interface requires too many clicks to do a common task, that&#39;s a mismatch between the software and the user&#39;s needs.</li>
<li>when a bureaucratic process isn&#39;t helping anyone, there&#39;s a mismatch between the process and the people involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixing a mismatch always means improving the <strong>interaction</strong> by changing the <strong>parts</strong>. Sometimes, we change the behavior of an existing part; sometimes we add or remove parts.</p>
<p>The measure of the system&#39;s health is the degree to which people are kind to each other, and own &amp; care for their environment.</p>
<p>The improvement process must be made self-sustaining, or you&#39;ll burn out. You must therefore create a virtuous cycle of improvement. That cycle is kindled by relationships of mutual trust. People trust programmers when they deliver results; therefore, if you are a programmer, start by honing these skills: <strong>test-driven and type-driven design, refactoring, and communication</strong>.</p>
