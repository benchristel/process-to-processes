<p>I set out to write a book for programmers about how to make better software. But I realized that the only way to make software better is to make the world better. So here we are.</p>
<p>Software inhabits a vast system of interacting, overlapping, recursively nested <em>centers</em>. A <em>center</em> is any cohesive organized structure that appears in spacetime. Examples include people, computers, apps, services, teams, meetings, processes, and companies. Improving the <em>whole system</em> of centers is both the motive and the method for improving software. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll start small.</p>
<p>To improve a system, we start by removing the friction, waste, and suffering that occur when different centers of <em>mismatched needs and behaviors</em> interact. Examples of mismatches:</p>
<ul>
<li>a software bug implies a mismatch between the software&#39;s behavior and its users&#39; expectations.</li>
<li>a user interface where a common task takes too many clicks implies a mismatch between the software and the user&#39;s needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixing a mismatch always means improving the <strong>interaction</strong> by changing the <strong>centers</strong>. Sometimes, we change how an existing center works; sometimes we add or remove centers.</p>
<p>The measure of the system&#39;s health is the degree to which people are kind to each other, and own &amp; care for their environment.</p>
<p>The improvement process must be made self-sustaining, or you&#39;ll burn out. You must therefore create a virtuous cycle of improvement. That cycle is kindled by relationships of mutual trust. People trust programmers when they deliver results; therefore, if you are a programmer, start by honing these skills: <strong>test-driven and type-driven design, refactoring, and communication</strong>.</p>
