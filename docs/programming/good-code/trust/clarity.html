			<h1 id="clarity">Clarity</h1>
<p>Code is clear when:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can see what its author meant it to do, by reading it.</li>
<li>We can easily assess (perhaps via a combination of inspection and automated tests) whether the code actually does what it&#39;s supposed to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clarity is, in theory, orthogonal to correctness. It&#39;s possible for code to be clear but not correct, or correct but not clear. However, the two qualities are often found together, because when code is clear it&#39;s much easier to make it correct.</p>
<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>
<p>Code can help us understand its author&#39;s intent in many different ways. The most commonly cited are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit tests. Tests document, in machine-executable form, the possible inputs to the code that the author anticipated. They also verify that the code&#39;s output in response to those inputs is what the author wanted.</li>
<li>Variable and function names.</li>
<li>Comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the most powerful way to make code communicate intent is to make it <a href="simplicity.html">simple</a>. People have different definitions of what &quot;simple&quot; code is, but I have a very specific definition in mind. In simple code, every conditional, iteration statement (e.g. loop), and variable is there for a demonstrable reason—preferably actually demonstrated by a test. None of them can be eliminated without rendering the code incorrect.</p>
<p>Some programmers seem to believe that making code simple means eliminating abstractions—that is, minimizing the number of function and class definitions. While I think that reducing abstraction is sometimes the right move, that&#39;s not what I mean by simplicity. The question of whether a given abstraction hurts or helps the code as a whole is separate from simplicity.</p>
<!--

```js
// This code isn't as simple as it could be; the initial length check is not needed
// because Array.some() always returns false if the array is empty.
function hasAVowel(word) {
  if (word.length === 0) {
    return false
  }
  const letters = [...word]
  return letters.some(isVowel)
}
```

Some readers might opine that the length check makes the code more explicit and is thus desirable even if it's not technically necessary. I say you should put that information in a unit test:

```js
describe("hasAVowel", () => {
  it("returns false given a 'word' with no letters", () => {
    expect(hasAVowel("")).toBe(false)
  })

  // ...
})
```

## Assessing Correctness



More subtly, code can make it obvious by its structure that certain undesirable states or behaviors are in fact impossible. Consider the following two snippets of code:

```js
const messages = ["hello", "goodbye"]
let i = 0
while (true) {
  console.log(messages[i])
  i++
  if (i === messages.length) {
    break
  }
}
```

```js
const messages = ["hello", "goodbye"]
for (i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
  console.log(messages[i])
}
```

These examples do the same thing, but it's more obvious that the `for` loop is guaranteed to terminate.

In TypeScript, we can craft types to precisely describe the possible values that a variable might hold. More on this in future chapters.

<h2 id="limitations-of-clarity">Limitations of Clarity</h2>
<p>Clarity makes code easier to read, but in large codebases, it&#39;s not enough. We don&#39;t have <em>time</em> to read all the code; we need code that lets us avoid reading as much of it as possible. The quality of code that makes this tenable is <em>abstractness</em>, which will be explored in the next chapter.</p>
