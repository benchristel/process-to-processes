			<h1 id="process-and-processes">Process and Processes</h1>
<p>The title of this book, <em>Process to Processes</em>, refers to the twin facts that 1) all software is developed by some kind of <em>process</em>, and 2) the ultimate result of software development is a set of running <em>processes</em> on one or more computers. Processes are the beginning and the end of software development, and they often show up in the middle, too. I will refer to the first type of process as a <em>development process</em>, and to the second type of process as a <em>software process</em>.</p>
<h2 id="software-processes">Software Processes</h2>
<p>A software process is the running instantiation of a program. Programs are static data: bytes of code written to a file. Processes, by contrast, are dynamic, mercurial; real and yet intangible. In the same way that sheet music comes to life when an orchestra performs it, a program comes to life by directing the movements of a process.</p>
<pre><code>program : computer : process :: sheet music : orchestra : concert
</code></pre>
<p>On a macOS or Linux system, you can list the currently running processes by running <code>ps aux</code> at a terminal.</p>
<p>A single program may give rise to many independent processes. If you have <code>node</code> installed on your computer, you can see that this is true by opening several terminal windows and running <code>node</code> in each one. Each time you run <code>node</code>, you get a JavaScript interpreter where you can type JavaScript statements and have them execute. These interpreters are independent. For example, variables that you define in one don&#39;t affect the others. The reason this is so is that each invocation of <code>node</code> produces a new process with its own <em>state</em>, its own memory of the things that have happened to it. Throughout all of this, the <em>program</em> <code>node</code> is unaffected. The 86 million or so bytes in its file will remain unchanged no matter how many times you run it (though of course, they <em>will</em> change if you upgrade it). </p>
<p>Some modern operating systems, notably macOS, obscure the difference between programs and processes, by making <em>applications</em> the primary user-facing concept. The operating system&#39;s user interface doesn&#39;t let you run multiple instances of an app simultaneously. However, this restriction is superficial: a matter of policy, not a limitation of the underlying mechanism, which is still &quot;everything is a process&quot;. If you try hard enough, you can run e.g. multiple instances of Firefox on macOS.</p>
<h2 id="a-definition-of-process">A Definition of &quot;Process&quot;</h2>
<p>Operating system processes are quite complicated due to features like shared memory and threads. When writing JavaScript, though, we don&#39;t have to think about these complications. We can reason about our software processes in a more abstract way. In this section, we will refine a definition of &quot;process&quot; that is a suitable description of the life of a running JavaScript program. Incidentally, we can base this simpler definition of &quot;process&quot; on the concept of a Turing machine, which is perhaps <em>the</em> foundational concept of all of computer science. So we&#39;re on fairly solid ground here.</p>
<h3 id="turing-machines">Turing Machines</h3>
<p>TODO: definition of Turing machine</p>
<p>A system that is capable of simulating a Turing machine is said to be <em>Turing complete</em>, and is provably capable of computing anything that can be computed. In reality, <em>no</em> system can ever be Turing complete, because true Turing completeness requires infinite memory. In practice, though, we usually hand-wave this away and refer to systems as Turing complete if they <em>would</em> be so given infinite memory and perfectly reliable hardware.</p>
<h3 id="an-aside-on-turing-completeness">An Aside on Turing Completeness</h3>
<p>When I first learned about Turing completeness, the concept bothered me because it seemed to have little relationship to the <em>practical</em> capabilities of a system. For example, one of my teachers mentioned that SQL is Turing complete. &quot;Does that mean you can write graphical user interfaces in SQL?&quot; I wondered. The answer to this question, frustratingly, turns out to be &quot;it depends, but in general, no, because the environments in which SQL code runs (e.g. databases) don&#39;t provide any facilities for creating windows or graphical widgets&quot;. I didn&#39;t fully understand how this could be. <em>Computers</em> can create graphical user interfaces, clearly. SQL is Turing complete, so it can compute anything that can be computed. Why can&#39;t it do everything a computer can do? Why can&#39;t it create a GUI?</p>
<p>The distinction I was missing was that between <em>computation</em>, which occurs within a process, and <em>effects</em>, which are enabled by the <em>environment</em> where the process runs. We&#39;ll explore this distinction in much more detail in later chapters, but for now, note the following properties of Turing machines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turing machines get all their input in the form of symbols on the tape, and all the input must be on the tape when the machine starts. Turing machines can&#39;t, for instance, call web services or prompt a user for input. In fact, Turing machines have no concept of users, web services, or any other real-world entities—not even computers—because they are purely abstract, mathematical objects. The &quot;tape&quot; of a Turing machine is a convenient metaphor.</li>
<li>Turing machines produce all their output as symbols on the tape, too. There is no <code>console.log</code> or graphical display on a Turing machine. To read the result of a computation from the tape, you simply have to know where to look, and what the symbols mean.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deterministic-processes">Deterministic Processes</h3>
<p>A <em>deterministic process</em> is a sequence of <em>states</em>, defined by an initial state, S<sub>0</sub>, and an <em>algorithm</em> that obtains the (n+1)<sup>th</sup> state, S<sub>n+1</sub>, from the n<sup>th</sup> state, S<sub>n</sub>. Each state is a <em>value</em>, which you can think of as a bundle of information—or, if you like, as a data structure. The sequence of states in a deterministic process is infinite. A deterministic process is said to <em>halt</em> if it ends with one state repeating infinitely (note that if a state appears twice consecutively, it will repeat forever after that). If the process eventually repeats some sequence of states with length &gt; 1 (i.e. enters a nontrivial infinite loop), we say it <em>crashes</em>.</p>
<p>The following TypeScript function evolves a deterministic process until it halts, by repeatedly calling <code>next</code> on the current state to obtain the next state.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">function evolve&lt;State&gt;(initialState: State, next: (s: State) =&gt; State): State {
  let state = initialState
  while (!equal(state, next(state))) {
    state = next(state)
  }
  return state
}
</code></pre>
<!--
But what exactly *is* a process? We have an intuitive notion of what a *development process* is, abstracted from examples like Scrum, Extreme Programming, and Waterfall. A development process tells you what steps to follow to make software. We also use the word "process" to mean the running instantiation of a _program_. We can list the running *processes* on a macOS or Linux computer using the `ps aux` command. Is there some notion of a process that is general enough to cover both of these senses of the word? I think there is.

## Definition of "Process"

A process is a sequence of _states_, defined by an initial state, S<sub>0</sub>, and an _algorithm_ that obtains the (n+1)<sup>th</sup> state, S<sub>n+1</sub>, from the n<sup>th</sup> state, S<sub>n</sub>. You can think of each state as a bundle of information—or, if you like, as a data structure. The sequence of states in a process is potentially infinite.

Let's first look at how this definition applies to software processes. Suppose we have the following JavaScript program:

```js
let i = 1;
while (i < 10) {
  i++;
}
```

There is one variable in this program, `i`, so we can model the state of the process it generates as a data structure holding a number and some indication of which line of the program will be executed next. Something like this (TypeScript):

```ts
type State = {i?: number, nextLine: number}
```

When our program starts running, the initial state is (conceptually):

```js
state = {i: undefined, nextLine: 1}
```

The first line of the program sets `i` to `1`. After that line executes, our state is:

```js
state = {i: 1, nextLine: 2}
```

The second line of the program checks whether `i` is less than `10`, continuing at line 3 if so and at line 4 if not. In this case, `i` *is* less than `10`, so we go to line 3. The next state is:

```js
state = {i: 1, nextLine: 3}
```

Line 3 increments `i` and loops back to line 2.

```js
state = {i: 2, nextLine: 2}
```

On line 2, we perform the check again; `i` is still less than 10, so we go back to line 3.

```js
state = {i: 2, nextLine: 3}
```

The state keeps evolving as we go around and around the loop. Eventually, `i` reaches 10. Here's what the state looks like immediately after `i` is incremented to 10 on line 3:

```js
state = {i: 10, nextLine: 2}
```

Back on line 2, the `i < 10` comparison evaluates to `false`. We go to line 4.

```js
state = {i: 10, nextLine: 4}
```

Line 4 is the end of the program, so each subsequent state in the process will be the same as the current one. Our process has *halted*.

This precise definition of a process isn't a perfect fit for either *software processes* or *software development processes*, though the nature of the misfit is different in each case.

The definition doesn't perfectly apply to software processes because the state of a software process can be changed by an intervention from outside the process (e.g. an _interrupt_, or the result of a _system call_). So the process's algorithm doesn't fully determine the sequence of states.
