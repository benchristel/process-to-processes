			<h1 id="good-code">Good Code</h1>
<p>We all want to do our best work. We all want our work to create joy and not create suffering. For those of us who are programmers, this starts with writing &quot;good code&quot;.</p>
<p>Everyone has a slightly different idea of what &quot;good code&quot; is, and I encourage you to develop your own. By way of offering inspiration, though, here is my definition.</p>
<p>Good code is code that works for the needs of today, and is easy to build on to meet the needs of tomorrow. Specifically, good code is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="correctness.html">Correct</a>: it does what its programmers intended.<ul>
<li>includes functional correctness, maybe performance?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="economy.html">Economical</a>: it doesn&#39;t cost too much to develop, release, or run.<ul>
<li>development time</li>
<li>execution time - as efficient as it needs to be to satisfy its users.</li>
<li><a href="trustworthiness.html">Trustworthy</a>: its correctness and performance characteristics are easy to verify. If our code isn&#39;t trustworthy, we&#39;ll take longer to release it, which has an opportunity cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="sustainability.html">Sustainable</a>: it doesn&#39;t impede the organization from accomplishing its goals. In particular, good code doesn&#39;t impede its own further development.<ul>
<li><a href="comfort.html">Comfortable</a>: it is simply nice to work with and live in. It seems at ease in its own skin, and isn&#39;t trying to be anything it doesn&#39;t need to be. Concretely, that means it is constrained only by what really matters: the users&#39; needs, the programmers&#39; human strengths and weaknesses, and the development tools available.</li>
<li><a href="repairability.html">Repairable</a>: good code has &quot;seams&quot; where you can pull it apart, to repair, replace, or upgrade just one piece of it.</li>
<li><a href="#">Educational</a>: it helps maintain its own quality by being exemplary. Good code is merely unsurprising, but great code can teach you something new about how to solve a problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="mutual-benefit.html">Mutually beneficial</a>: it has positive externalities, conveying benefit to all the people and systems it touches.<ul>
<li><a href="reusability.html">Reusable</a>: Repairability goes hand in hand with reusability: a module that can be isolated from the rest of its program for repair can also, quite possibly, be used in other contextsâ€”perhaps in entirely different programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
