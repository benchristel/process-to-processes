<p>Related misconception: most of the work of programming is communicating ideas to the machine.</p>
<p>People who have tried a bit of programming but not immersed themselves in it often find that just communicating with the machine—getting it to do anything at all other than spit out an error message—is devilishly difficult. As a result, they assume that that&#39;s the hard part of programming. But it&#39;s actually the easiest part. The real work begins only <em>after</em> you have mastered syntax, and can reliably get your programs to run. Then you encounter hard questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I actually want this program to do?</li>
<li>How can I tell if this program will do what I want in all circumstances?</li>
<li>How can I change my program without breaking it for its current users?</li>
<li>How can I communicate my mental model of the program to the people who have to use, extend, and repair it?</li>
<li>How can I make the program fast, yet reliable?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions rest on your ability to phrase your solutions in a way that is precise and formal, yet easy to understand. <strong>The trick (if there is one) is to make precision and formality your allies.</strong> With the right framing, they can be an aid to understanding rather than an obstacle. The rest of this book explores how to make that happen.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve mastered syntax, software development is mostly:</p>
<ul>
<li>learning about the domain</li>
<li>abstract problem solving</li>
</ul>
