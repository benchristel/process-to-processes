<p>Some programmers are <em>lucky</em>.</p>
<p>They rarely have to use a debugger. Their code just works.</p>
<p>When someone reports a bug in their code, they already seem to know how to fix it.</p>
<p>They make unusual design choices, and can&#39;t quite explain why. But somehow, as if by coincidence, their choices pay off.</p>
<p><em>as if they could predict the future.</em></p>
<p>Their work doesn&#39;t look difficultâ€”their code changes are simple, like something anyone could do.</p>
<p>They never seem to tackle big problems. They go around solving trivial little
problems.</p>
<p>But when they&#39;re done, the solution to the big problem is only 5 lines.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-programmers-become-lucky">How Do Programmers Become Lucky?</h2>
<p>Programmers are not born lucky. They become lucky through continuous practice and reflection. Their luck is something they make for themselves.</p>
<p>They&#39;re humble enough to not assume they know the answer, so they can see things as they are.</p>
<p>Working with things as they are, letting them take their natural shape, is how you become lucky.</p>
<p>When you let the code take its natural shape, you don&#39;t need to force it into shape.</p>
<p>When you know how things will naturally unfold, there are fewer unpleasant surprises.</p>
<p>You prevent problems simply by not creating ways for problems to happen.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Lucky programmers&#39; code looks very precise.</p>
<p>Its concepts are crisply defined, laser-focused.</p>
<p>It cuts like a razor.</p>
<p>But it is fluid, graceful. Try to kill it with a failing test, and it dances out of the way.</p>
<p>A little wriggle, and the test passes.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-a-lucky-programmer">I Am a Lucky Programmer</h2>
<p>And I want you to be one, too.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know of a book that teaches this.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m writing this one.</p>
