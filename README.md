# Process to Processes

_Engineering Software Applications_

This is an HTML book hosted at https://benchristel.github.io/process-to-processes

## Development

The HTML lives in `docs/`, the markdown sources in `src/`. To build the HTML
from the markdown, you need [mdsite](https://github.com/benchristel/mdsite).

Once you have `mdsite` installed, `./build` should do what you want.
