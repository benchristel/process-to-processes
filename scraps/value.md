## Value

**Value** is shorthand for "what is intrinsically good".

Value is not profit. Profit is an indirect result of value.

Consider the architecture of Sorrento, a beautiful city in Italy. To say that the buildings and public spaces of the city have *value* is simply to say that people like them: that they are beautiful, pleasant places to be. Because of this intrinsic value, the city has a thriving tourism industry, which generates revenue for the city. That is the connection between value and profit.

Why do we, as software developers, concern ourselves with value and not profit? Profit is not something we can directly control. There are too many factors influencing it. It is a fool's game to try to link a change in profits back to the efforts of an individual engineer or even an engineering team.

By contrast, value can be perceived more or less directly, objectively, and immediately. We can do quick tests to judge which of two alternatives is more or less valuable, even before putting our changes into production.

Judging value accurately, however, is challenging for many software developers. For many of us, our education has trained us to systematically ignore the kind of value I am talking about. To begin to perceive it, we have to reawaken a long-buried part of ourselves. This begins with learning a new mode of perception.

If we are to "improve the system", steadily adding to its value, we have to learn to see the system clearly. The fundamental constituents of any system are **centers**.
