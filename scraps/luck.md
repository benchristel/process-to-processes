# Preface: The Lucky Programmer

Some programmers are _lucky_.

They rarely have to use a debugger. Their code just works.

When someone reports a bug in their code, they already seem to know how to fix it.

They make unusual design choices, and can't quite explain why. But somehow, as if by coincidence, their choices pay off.

_as if they could predict the future._

Their work doesn't look difficultâ€”their code changes are simple, like something anyone could do.

They never seem to tackle big problems. They go around solving trivial little
problems.

But when they're done, the solution to the big problem is only 5 lines.

## How Do Programmers Become Lucky?

Programmers are not born lucky. They become lucky through continuous practice and reflection. Their luck is something they make for themselves.

They're humble enough to not assume they know the answer, so they can see things as they are.

Working with things as they are, letting them take their natural shape, is how you become lucky.

When you let the code take its natural shape, you don't need to force it into shape.

When you know how things will naturally unfold, there are fewer unpleasant surprises.

You prevent problems simply by not creating ways for problems to happen.

## Code

Lucky programmers' code looks very precise.

Its concepts are crisply defined, laser-focused.

It cuts like a razor.

But it is fluid, graceful. Try to kill it with a failing test, and it dances out of the way.

A little wriggle, and the test passes.

## I Am a Lucky Programmer

And I want you to be one, too.

I don't know of a book that teaches this.

That's why I'm writing this one.
