# Attitude

The fundamental process relies on practitioners adopting certain attitudes toward their work:

- **Humility.** The opposite of grandiosity. This manifests as a willingness to admit you don't have all the answers, and to make many small changes rather than large, risky ones.
- **Kindness.** Good engineers recognize that everything they experience is part of one interconnected system. Healing the system is healing yourself. Healing yourself is healing the system.
- **Transparency and Trust.** The process requires that programmers have the autonomy and permission to experiment. The organization must trust the programmers and not micromanage. Programmers earn the organization's trust by delivering good work quickly and reliably. But this is only possible if programmers are transparent about the constraints and costs that affect their work.
- **Letting go.** Maturing as a software organization means letting go of the unattainable desire for certainty and control: abandoning elaborate plans and Procrustean processes in favor of a more adaptive approach that is grounded in what really matters to people.
