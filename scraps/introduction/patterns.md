# Patterns

Experienced engineers develop _patterns_ for doing [design](design.html). These take the form _if {A, B, C ...} are true, then maybe Y is a good idea_. Of course, you still have to evaluate whether Y is actually a good idea, but at least the pattern gives you a clue about what to try. Much of this book is devoted to describing patterns.
