# The Author's Notes to Himself

Don't write complete paragraphs yet. It will only prove a waste of time when you inevitably realize what you've forgotten and have to refactor things to incorporate the new material.

Before you write complete sentences, you should prime the pump by reading Raymond, or Gabriel, or Knuth, or Garc√≠a-Molina.
