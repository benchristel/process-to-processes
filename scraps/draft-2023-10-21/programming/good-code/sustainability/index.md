# Sustainability

Economic sustainability is not the only consideration, though; we also have to consider the _psychological_ sustainability of working on the code. Techniques that require a high level of discipline to be effective are not psychologically sustainable. Everyone has "off" days, and most of us can't call in sick whenever we're feeling scatterbrained. If working on the system demands constant vigilance, the code will slowly but surely degrade, until it becomes a quagmire.

The surest bulwark against psychological unsustainability is joy. Working on the code should make us feel confident, competent, and in control. Good code makes us feel more connected to our work and to each other.

In the chapters that follow, I will discuss each of the qualities of good code in turn, and provide techniques for obtaining them.
