# View: Simple Code

Simple code is code that makes only those distinctions that are necessary to produce the desired {{link Behavior}}.

The clearest example of a "distinction" is an `if` statement.

Simple code doesn't mean the first implementation that pops into your head. It can take a lot of effort to make code simple, but the readability and confidence in {{link Behavior}} you gain is usually worth it.

Simple code is also not the same thing as readable code, though simplicity and readability are correlated.
