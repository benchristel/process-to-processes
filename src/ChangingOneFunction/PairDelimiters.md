This technique applies {{link SmallSteps}} at the tiniest possible scale. When you're typing, strive to keep the intervals in which your code is not syntactically valid as short as possible. That means, when you type an opening delimiter (parenthesis or brace), immediately type the matching closing delimiter (or configure your editor to do it for you).
