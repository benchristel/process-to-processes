# Technique: Start with a Walking Skeleton âœ¥

Summary: A tiny, featureless, yet "complete" and working whole. A walking skeleton is a hilariously overbuilt "hello world" app that includes all the scaffolding on which you will hang your real functionality.

Trigger: you are starting a project

Evaluator: you shouldn't need to mess with the infrastructure (much) as you develop the skeleton into something useful. You can separate infrastructure changes from feature changes. New people on the team can get up and running easily.

Move: create a "hello world" app that uses the architecture and tools appropriate to your project. Including:

- version control
- production deployment or installer
- package manager
- dev build / server
- test runner
- typechecker
- linter
- formatter
- git hooks
- developer documentation
- editor configuration
- frontend/backend interaction
- database
