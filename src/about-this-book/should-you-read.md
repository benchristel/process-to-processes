# Should You Read This Book?

You should read at least some part of this book if you are a programmer or
other technical practitioner working in the software industry, and have at
least a year or so of industry experience.

This book teaches many things, but the syntax of a programming language is not
one of them. Before reading this book, you should grok the fundamentals of
functions, variables, conditionals, loops, strings, arrays, and objects. If
you're learning to code, I highly recommend [Marijn Haverbeke's _Eloquent
JavaScript_](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).

The examples in this book are in TypeScript. Because it is a multi-paradigm
language, and because it allows but does not require static types, TypeScript
is an excellent vehicle for comparing various approaches to programming.

## Which Part of This Book Should You Read?

Don't skip the initial chapter on [Myths and Misconceptions](../myths-and-misconceptions). After reading that...

You should read [Part I](../programming) if you write or test computer programs.

You should read [Part II](../working-with-others) if you are a programmer working with other programmers.

You should read [Part II](../programming-with-others) if you are a manager.

You should read [Part III](../user-interfaces) if you are involved in the creation of user interfaces. This section may be interesting to designers as well as programmers.

You should read [Part IV](../tao) once you've mastered the rest of the book.
