# The Fundamental Process

The fundamental process for all software development activities is a variant of the OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loop, which goes like this:

1. **Observe** the system in its current state. Don't judge what's good or bad about it just yet, but note any suffering that is occurring.
2. **Form a theory** about how the system works. The theory must be able to predict how the system will respond to possible future changes and events.
3. **Decide what to change.** Identify some suffering that your theory says you might be able to alleviate.
3. **Try** to change the system. Avoid changing too much at once. Make the smallest change you can that will have an impact you can observe. Make sure the change is reversable, since there's a good chance your theory is wrong and the improvement you predict will not happen.
4. **Assess** the results. Did things get better or worse? If they got worse, undo the change you made. In any case, go back to step 1 and repeat the process.

All software development boils down to these five steps, repeated over and over at various levels of scale.

## Observing the System

Once you have identified the centers in your software development system, you can watch them interact. Observe the flow of resources—especially money and information—among the centers. Withhold judgment, for now. Just watch the system and accept that what's you see is what's happening.

_A customer complains. A UX change request shows up in your backlog. A programmer commits to version control. A failing test run gets retried. A new version your product is released. QA does a full test pass. There are 7 reported regressions. A lucrative deal closes. A new business unit forms. An engineering team struggles with technical debt. The CEO calls an all-hands meeting; most of the attendees spend it multitasking._

## Forming a Theory

As you observe the system, you will naturally start telling yourself stories about _why_ the system is the way it is. You'll form mental models of the various actors in the system, and you'll see how their actions affect other centers. These explanatory stories and characterizations form a _theory_ of the system that you can use to predict what might happen to it in the future.

The longer and more carefully you observe, the more refined your theory will become. You'll see situations where your initial theory made incorrect predictions, and you'll revise your theory to match these new observations. You can often get more perspectives by interviewing participants in the system, and refine your theory that way. However, attempting to create a perfect theory—trying to find out what's "really" going on—is a quixotic goal. A perfect theory is neither necessary nor attainable. Once you have a predictive theory of any quality, you should probably move quickly to the next step: deciding what to change.

## Deciding what to Change

## Making a Change

Making a change breaks down into two sub-steps:

- Deciding what change to make
-
