# Resistance

_Note: an earlier draft of this page used the term "suffering" instead of "resistance". I haven't updated the text yet._

As you observe, pay special attention to suffering in the system. **This is not the same thing as judging interactions as good or bad.** Your judgments are subjective and conditioned by your experience. Suffering is objective. **Suffering occurs when two centers are in conflict: when one is resisting or working against the other.** Frustration, inner conflict, and thwarted desire all produce suffering.

The following anecdote might help explain the difference between judgments, objective defects, and suffering. I once pair-programmed with a developer—let's call him L—who was not used to unit testing. I thought that not having unit tests was bad (my judgment) and tried to convince him that having some tests would help us release with fewer defects. His response? "So what if the software has a few bugs? If customers report bugs, we'll patch them." When I said I'd rather not release buggy software in the first place, he became a bit disgruntled. He was reluctant to pair after that.

I couldn't convince L that adding unit tests was a good idea, because I presented tests as a way to avoid bugs, and the bugs in his code weren't causing him any suffering. His manager wasn't telling him to write fewer bugs. His other teammates weren't telling him to write fewer bugs. There was nothing in the system or within himself that resisted his current way of working—until  I arrived and tried to sell unit testing to him. I was the only thing making him suffer, so he did the obvious thing in response: he avoided me.

Suffering is distinct from pain and discomfort. When suffering occurs within a person, it is because two parts of their mind are in conflict. Often, the conflict is _about_ a source of pain or discomfort, which is why we associate suffering with these phenomena.

For example, imagine you're in the middle of an exercise routine—running, perhaps. You're out of breath, your heart is pounding, and your joints and muscles ache. You're experiencing discomfort and pain. But you only start suffering when some part of your mind speaks up and says _you know, we could stop and walk for a bit_ and another part of your mind counters with _no, we have to keep going!_ If you were wholeheartedly committed to your exercise regimen, you wouldn't dream of stopping, and you wouldn't suffer. If you were wholeheartedly committed to stopping, you'd just stop, and you wouldn't suffer. You only suffer when different parts of your mind have conflicting goals.

Suffering can be associated with pleasure as well as with pain. For example, suppose you're tempted to stay up late playing video games, but you know you'd regret it the next morning. While just thinking about video games is inherently pleasant, that thought still causes suffering because it conflicts with the more prudent part of your mind that countermands it.

Suppose you do stay up all night playing games, though, and you are tired the next morning. Your suffering at that point isn't caused by the tiredness itself, but by your desire to either sleep or be more alert. Since you probably can't do either, your desire is in conflict with reality, and so you suffer.
