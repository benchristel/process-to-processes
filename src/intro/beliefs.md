# Things I Believe to be True About Software

Software can be understood.

Specifically, _you_ can understand the software you work on.

If you change what you don't understand, you are doomed to break it.

If software has a bug, glitch, or error, it is because some human made it that wayâ€”either by mistake or on purpose (e.g. to make a tradeoff). Computers are never possessed by demons or ghosts.

Computers are deterministic machines, though their behavior, in aggregate, can be chaotic.

Every action in a software development process is undertaken in pursuit of some purpose. But not every action does what we think it will do, and not all purposes are noble, and this is where dysfunction comes from.

Software is an image of the system that produced it (this is Conway's law).

To fully understand any software, you must understand its creators.

In software development, as in life, every unbendable rule is a weakness. Pragmatism beats purity.

The system that exists has a major competitive advantage over the system that is merely imagined.

Just as you cannot map a territory you have never set foot in, you cannot plan a software project in detail
without creating the thing your plan would purport to describe.

The future, once it arrives, will feel just as mundane as the present.

There are things that can be known, but not taught in words.

If you only know words, you understand nothing.

Intelligence is a behavior of bodies situated in a culture. Your health, happiness, and values constrain your intellectual acts.

Aesthetics matter. The only question is, who should have a say in how something looks and feels?

The biggest problem facing software today is our inadequate menu of cosmologies.
