# Things I Believe About Software

Software can be understood.

Specifically, _you_ can understand the software you work on.

If you change what you don't understand, you are doomed to break it.

If software has a bug, glitch, or error, it is because some human made it that wayâ€”either by mistake or on purpose (e.g. to make a tradeoff). Computers are never possessed by demons or ghosts.

Computers are deterministic machines, though their behavior, in aggregate, can be chaotic.

All hard problems in software arise from the need for efficiency, the need for concision, and the tension between them.

Every action in a software development process is undertaken in pursuit of some purpose. But not every action does what we think it will do, and not all purposes are noble, and this is where dysfunction comes from.

Suffering is resistance. Nothing more, nothing less.

Software is an image of the system that produced it (this is Conway's law).

To fully understand any software, you must understand its creators, customers, and users.

In software development, as in life, every unbendable rule is a weakness. Pragmatism beats purity.

The system that exists has a major competitive advantage over the system that is merely imagined.

Science is the best tool we have for making accurate predictions.

The only legitimate use for a scientific theory is to make a prediction.

A useful and productive analogy can be drawn between scientific theories and software code.
Test-driven development is the software equivalent of the scientific method.

Immediate, reliable feedback obviates most other software development conveniences.

You cannot plan a software project in detail without creating the software along the way,
in the same way that you cannot map a territory you have never set foot in. Though you might like to have
a map before you go there, you can't make the map until you've been there.

There are things that can be known, but not taught in words.

If you only know words, you understand nothing.

Intelligence is a behavior of bodies situated in a culture. Your health, happiness, and environs constrain your intellectual acts.

Aesthetics matter. The only question is, who should have a say in how something looks and feels?

Culture selects the permissible from the possible. The future will be what we choose to make it.

The future, once it arrives, will feel just as mundane as the present.

The biggest problem facing software today is our inadequate menu of mythologies.
