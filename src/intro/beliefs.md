# Things I Believe to be True About Software

Software can be understood.

Specifically, _you_ can understand the software you work on.

If you change what you don't understand, you are doomed to break it.

If software has a bug, glitch, or error, it is because some human made it that wayâ€”either by mistake or on purpose (e.g. to make a tradeoff). Computers are never possessed by demons or ghosts.

Computers are deterministic machines, though their behavior, in aggregate, can be chaotic.

Every action in a software development process is undertaken in pursuit of some purpose. But not every action does what we think it will do, and not all purposes are noble, and this is where dysfunction comes from.

Software is an image of the system that produced it (this is Conway's law).

To fully understand any software, you must understand its creators.

Aesthetics matter. The only question is, who should have a say in how something looks and feels?
