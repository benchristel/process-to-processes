# The Software Development System

The first step in the process is to observe the system in operation.

Recall that when I talk about "the system", I mean not only computers and software, but also people, organizations, and physical structures: teams, vendors, customers, office buildings, departments, etc. These various types of substructure may overlap quite a bit, and it is likely impossible to organize them into a strict tree-shaped taxonomy. For example, the UX design department in your organization may be a cohesive structure, but each designer within the department may be embedded in a different cross-functional team that includes engineers and a product manager—and those cross-functional teams may also be cohesive structures. A team, in turn, may be spread across multiple offices, and an office may house multiple teams.

This absence of tree-like taxonomic or hierarchical structure is neither a weakness to be eliminated, nor a metric to be optimized for its own sake. It is simply the kind of organization that happens, and that has to happen, in systems that are healthy and self-sustaining.

To acknowledge the fuzziness and non-hierarchical organization of software development systems, I call the sub-structures _centers_ (following the lead of the architect Christopher Alexander). Centers are cohesive and identifiable; you can name them, point to them, count them, and recognize ones you've seen before. However, centers do not necessarily have a precise boundary, so they may not be separable from their context.

The concept of a center may seem a bit hard to grasp. However, I am sure that you already have an intuitive and practical sense of the concept, though you may not be used to paying attention to centers or talking about them.

To see that you already understand what a center is, imagine a whirlpool in a stream.

What is a whirlpool? It's not a set of water molecules. The physical material that makes up the whirlpool is rapidly and constantly changing. It's also not an exact shape; the particular ripples in the water are constantly changing. It's not separable from the stream itself; you can't lift it out of the water and take it home with you.

Yet you can point to it. You can name it. If there are several whirlpools, you can count them. If you come back the next day and the whirlpool is still there, you can say "it's the same one I saw yesterday". If you know you can do all those things, then you know what a center is.

There are, of course, also centers that are more like "objects"—things that _can_ mostly be separated from their context, and that _do_ have a more or less consistent physical makeup. You are used to thinking and talking about these, so I won't dwell on them.
