# Fundamentals

Read this section first!

The subsequent sections of this book will interest different audiences. Programmers may want to start with {{link ChangingOneFunction/index "Changing Code Within One Function"}}; managers with {{link WorkingOnATeam/index "Working on a Team"}}; UX designers with {{link UserInterfaces}}. However, everyone should first read this section, **Fundamentals**. Otherwise, the rest of the book will probably be inscrutable.
