# Fundamentals

Read this section first!

The subsequent sections of this book will interest different audiences. Programmers may want to start with {{link ChangingOneFunction/index "Changing Code Within One Function"}}; managers with {{link WorkingOnATeam/index "Working on a Team"}}; UX designers with {{link UserInterfaces}}. However, everyone should first read this section, **Fundamentals**. Otherwise, the rest of the book will probably be inscrutable.

We'll start with an overview of the types of information you'll find in this book — {{link Techniques}}, {{link Principles}}, and {{link Views}}.

Then we'll dig into the foundations of empirical software development: {{link Empiricism}} informed by {{link Judgment}}, an ability to {{link ExplainWhy}} we do things, and a healthy irreverence toward tools, techniques, and methods — {{link ToolsNotRules}}.

Next, we will look at the constraints that shape every software project, starting with our own inherent limitations and abilities ({{link Fundamentals/Humans "Humans, Not Humanoids"}}). We'll learn to see our human-computer {{link Fundamentals/Systems Systems}} as {{link InformationFlows}} among {{link Centers}}, and we'll see how friction in those information flows reveals {{link Conflict}} between the {{link Forces}} that shape the system.

Finally, we will see that whatever distress we experience at work is simply the subjective experience of this objective conflict between forces. And we will see that this subjective distress is an indicator of the system's inability to sustain itself — {{link LifeAndDeath "The Life and Death of Systems"}}.

The task of software development, so described, might seem dismally difficult. But there's a light at the end of the tunnel: a way of healing a failing system in spite of seemingly intractable complexity. The way forward begins by building {{link Trust}}.
