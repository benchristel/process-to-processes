# Principle: Judgment

No one can tell you exactly how to do your job. If they could, your job would be automated, and it would cease to be yours. The key reason to keep {{link Fundamentals/Humans Humans}} around in a software development system is that they are capable of exercising good judgment in complex, uncertain, high-risk environments. In other words, you're paid to make decisions your managers can't make wellâ€”because you have information they don't. See also {{link Autonomy}}.

Richard Cook put it this way:

> [A]ll practitioner actions are actually gambles, that is, acts that take place in the face of uncertain outcomes. The degree of uncertainty may change from moment to moment. That practitioner actions are gambles appears clear after accidents; in general, post hoc analysis regards these gambles as poor ones. But the converse: that successful outcomes are also the result of gambles; is not widely appreciated.
>
> [...] Organizations are ambiguous, often intentionally, about the relationship between production targets, efficient use of resources, economy and costs of operations, and acceptable risks of low and high consequence accidents. All ambiguity is resolved by actions of practitioners at the sharp end of the system.
>
> [...] People continuously create safety. Failure free operations are the result of activities of people who work to keep the system within the boundaries of tolerable performance. These activities are, for the most part, part of normal operations and superficially straightforward. But because system operations are never trouble free, human practitioner adaptations to changing conditions actually create safety from moment to moment.

What this means is that good judgment is a key attribute of any software engineer.
