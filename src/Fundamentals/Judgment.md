# View: Judgment

Our work as software developers involves us in some of the most complex deterministic logical systems that have ever existed. The essence of our job is to find ways of solving problems using abstract mechanisms that can operate without continual human intervention. We find it tempting, therefore, to imagine that there might be an algorithm for software development itself: input requirements, turn the crank, and software comes out. The "Judgment" view helps us see why no such algorithm can exist.

No one can tell you exactly how to do your job. If they could, your job would be automated, and it would cease to be yours. The key reason to keep {{link Fundamentals/Humans Humans}} around in a software development system is that they are capable of exercising good judgment in complex, uncertain, high-risk environments.

Judgment goes hand in hand with {{link Autonomy}}. You're paid to make decisions your managers can't make well—because you have information they don't. By its nature, management sets high-level goals — which often appear to be in {{link Conflict}} with one another — and leaves it to individuals to sort out how to satisfy those goals in context-sensitive ways. Judgment means weighing tradeoffs between {{link Forces}} and, where possible, finding designs that transcend tradeoffs.

Richard Cook put it this way:

> [A]ll practitioner actions are actually gambles, that is, acts that take place in the face of uncertain outcomes. The degree of uncertainty may change from moment to moment. That practitioner actions are gambles appears clear after accidents; in general, post hoc analysis regards these gambles as poor ones. But the converse: that successful outcomes are also the result of gambles; is not widely appreciated.
>
> [...] Organizations are ambiguous, often intentionally, about the relationship between production targets, efficient use of resources, economy and costs of operations, and acceptable risks of low and high consequence accidents. All ambiguity is resolved by actions of practitioners at the sharp end of the system.
>
> [...] People continuously create safety. Failure free operations are the result of activities of people who work to keep the system within the boundaries of tolerable performance. These activities are, for the most part, part of normal operations and superficially straightforward. But because system operations are never trouble free, human practitioner adaptations to changing conditions actually create safety from moment to moment.

What this means is that good judgment is a key attribute of any software engineer. Judgment is _what we do_ — it is, almost by definition, the part of our work that cannot be automated.

TODO: relate judgment to empiricism / the scientific method
