# View: Tools, Not Rules

There is no right way to program. There are only ways that are better or worse in different circumstances, and circumstances change all the time. Moment to moment, even.

- Solving a problem you've never solved before...
- Making your software work for all the {{link EdgeCase "edge cases"}}...
- Communicating your thoughts to someone else...
- Making your app scale to a million users...

...all these are different circumstances, and all require different approaches and different designs.

What this means for you is that you can stop trying to come up with perfect designs. There's no such thing. So relax! {{link MakeItRunMakeItRight}}. Do a thing, and then ask yourself how it could be better. Realizing your work could be better is not failureâ€”not even temporary failure. This is how the masters code.
