# Principles

**Principles** are idea-generators for coming up with new {{link Techniques}}. If we're in a situation where our known techniques don't apply, we can use principles to invent new techniques that are suited to that context.

Each principle prompts you to ask a different "how might we" question. "How might we _take smaller steps?_" "How might we _get feedback faster?_" "How might we _avoid breaking changes?_" "How might we _move authority to information?_" "How might we _reduce inventory?_" By brainstorming answers to these questions, you can discover new techniques. You can also assess existing techniques to see if they might be the answer to the question.

## Where Principles Come From

Principles are derived inductively from clusters of related techniques. The process goes like this:

- Look for similarities between techniques
- Infer a principle that explains the similarities
- Test the principle by using it to generate new techniques. A principle is useful to the degree that it helps you discover useful techniques.

This process echoes the scientific method, which we'll see shortly in the chapter on {{link Empiricism}}.

_Wait a minute_, you're probably saying. _Do techniques generate principles, or do principles generate techniques_? I can only answer "yes." Principles and techniques work together. Like so many other symbiotic partners in the world of software, they bootstrap each other into existence.
