# Principles

**Principles** are idea-generators for coming up with new {{link Techniques}}. If we're in a situation where our known techniques don't apply, we can use principles to invent new techniques that are suited to that context.

TODO: how should principles be phrased? One idea is "how might we..." questions. "How might we _take smaller steps?_" "How might we _get feedback faster?_" "How might we _avoid breaking changes?_" "How might we _move authority to information?_" "How might we _reduce inventory?_"

## Where Principles Come From

Principles are generated inductively from clusters of related techniques. The process goes like this:

- Look for similarities between techniques
- Infer a principle that explains the similarities
- Test the principle by using it to generate new techniques. A principle is useful if you can use it to discover useful techniques.

This process echoes the scientific method, which we'll see shortly in the chapter on {{link Empiricism}}.
