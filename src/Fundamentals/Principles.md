# Principles

Because {{link Techniques}} aren't hard-and-fast rules or universal "best practices," we need a way to figure out when we should and shouldn't use them.

**Principles** are idea-generators for coming up with new techniques. If we're in a situation where our known techniques don't apply, we can use principles to invent new techniques that are suited to that context.

Principles also help us figure out if a technique applies to our current situation. If using a given technique would violate many of our principles, it might not be the right technique to use.
