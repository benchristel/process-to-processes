# Techniques

This book consists mainly of **techniques** for software development. A technique is:

- something you do
- ...to solve a problem or pursue an opportunity
- ...in a particular context.

## Techniques Are Not Best Practices

A common mistake is to confuse techniques with "best practices" — things you should always (or almost always)
be doing. To put it bluntly, I don't believe in best practices — which is to say I think the "best practices" framing gives us a misleading and ineffective view of the solution space. Too often, I have seen people contort their systems by following "best practices," creating solutions that even they find {{link Alienating}} and hard to use.

Techniques are different: they are {{link ToolsNotRules}}. Armed with techniques, we can adopt radically simple defaults — such as {{link NaiveProgramming}} — and then override those defaults based on the presence of specific needs or {{link Forces}}. Each technique is an override.

This approach is made intellectually tractable by having a diverse array of techniques committed to memory. Once you've practiced the techniques in this book, relevant techniques will pop effortlessly into your mind whenever you see a problem or an opportunity. Your job then becomes to apply the technique (or in some cases, just to imagine applying it) and to {{link Judgment Judge}} the costs and benefits. If the benefits outweigh the costs, use the technique; if not, don't.
