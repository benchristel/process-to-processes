# View: Information Flows

In this chapter and the next one ({{link Centers}}) we will discuss the anatomy of a system.

If you try to draw a picture of a system, what you will end up with is a set of parts linked by arrows indicating relationships. We can describe a typical software system using arrows that represent flows of either information or money.

Information is the lifeblood of a software system. Viewed from a certain, abstracted perspective, all any software is really doing is moving information from one place to another, merging, splitting, and transforming it along the way.

> It can be argued that development of any kind is essentially a learning process and that it is primarily dependent on a network of information flows.
