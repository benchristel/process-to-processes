# Programming vs. Software Development vs. Software Engineering

I use the terms "programming," "software development," and "software engineering" in this book. Many people probably regard these as synonyms. Here's what these terms mean to me:

- **Programming** = changing software =~ getting code to work. What I do when I'm writing shell scripts for myself.
- **Software Development** = tending a {{link System}} of {{link Fundamentals/Humans Humans}}, machines, and {{link InformationFlows}} that harvests value from programming in order to sustain itself.
- **Software Engineering** = using mathematical and scientific principles to create software that resolves {{link Forces}}, including constraints of time and budget.

This book is about all three things.
