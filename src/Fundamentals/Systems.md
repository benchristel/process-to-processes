# View: Systems

- a system is a collection of interdependent parts
- dependency cycles mean that changes to one part of the system can start reinforcing feedback loops that amplify the change. This can even destroy the system.
- example: the human body, ecosystems
- how do systems with dependency cycles come into being?
  - one way: _bootstrapping_. A tiny thing grows in size and complexity, organizing itself as it grows. The organs end up interdependent.
  - another way: a simple mechanism produces things (output or waste) that affect the future operation of the mechanism. The whole (mechanism and outputs) becomes a system.
- software systems are one type of system

Example of interdependency in software systems: code, data, and users.

When an application is new, there is no data and no users. The code is therefore very flexible.

If the application is successful, it will accumulate data and users. The need to continue processing existing data, and continue serving existing users, constrains how the code can develop.
