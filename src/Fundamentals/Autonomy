# Principle: Autonomy

To get {{link Adaptation}}, people need autonomy to shape their local environment.

{{link Techniques}} support autonomy. If you give people autonomy, but they don't know good techniques, what you'll get is not working software but chaos. Techniques are the foundation that make autonomy viable.

Teams who aren't used to autonomy can quickly become overwhelmed by all the complexity they have to navigate when no one is telling them how they must do things. Therefore, it's best to ramp up autonomy gradually, letting teams take
on more and more responsibility for their decisions as they gain experience and prove their effectiveness.
