# Principle: Adaptation

A.K.A. The whole system grows together - people, software, tools. The software becomes adapted to the tools used to make it. The tools adapt to the software. The people in the system adapt the software and the tools to work for them.

The term "Adaptation" for this idea comes from Christopher Alexander: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6q1dDAv6zY

Examples of adaptation in software:

- One advantage of object oriented idioms is that the dot method syntax enables ergonomic autocomplete in IDEs. (see: Brian Will)
- Anecdote about prefixes for member variables in C++
- algebraic types enable data to be manipulated directly / coupled to lots of code without creating massive headaches
- TDD expands the horizon of problems you consider hard, lets you consider more solution paths
