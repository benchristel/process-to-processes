# Before we begin

Before we begin, I want to address a fear that many programmers have. Namely, the fear that:

- a) great programmers have figured out a reliable process for writing bug-free, efficient, maintainable code
- b) the process is hard to learn, and once you learn it, is bureaucratic, soul-sucking, and just generally no fun at all.

If this fear were true, we'd have to choose: do we want programming to be a joyful, exciting puzzle, full of twists and turns and little victories? Or do we want to learn what the masters know, and become code-factory drones poring over spreadsheets and twiddling bits?

The more I have learned from master programmers, the more I have realized that this fear, which I too once had, was unfounded. The deeper you go into expertise, the more fun and joy there is to be had. I hope this book will make that clear to you too.
