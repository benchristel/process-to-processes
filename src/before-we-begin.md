# Before we begin

Before we begin, I want to address a fear that many programmers have. Namely, the fear that:

- a) great programmers have figured out a reliable process for writing bug-free, efficient, maintainable code
- b) the process is hard to learn, and once you learn it, is bureaucratic, soul-sucking, and just generally no fun at all.

If this fear were true, we'd have to choose: do we want programming to be a joyful, exciting puzzle, full of twists and turns and little victories? Or do we want to learn what the masters know, and become code-factory drones poring over spreadsheets and twiddling bits?

I, too, once had this fear. I shied away from deeply technical talks by expert programmers because I felt sure that what they would say would invalidate my experiences and what I felt to be true about myself as a programmer. Gradually, as I started to pick up on what these experts had to say, I realized that my fear was an illusion. As you deepen your expertise, you find _more_ fun and joy in programming, not less. You discover _more_ good ways of doing things, not one "best" way. I hope this book will make that clear to you too.
