# it happens to the best of us - we write the code, unit test it, but forget to wire it up to anything.
# The way to prevent this is by first writing a failing test at an existing boundary, above the place
# where your new code will hook in. That way, you can't forget to close the circuit.

# if you want to "abstract away" specific behaviors,
# structure code so you cannot depend on specific behaviors.
