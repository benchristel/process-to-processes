# CI does NOT mean you are constantly releasing new software to users/customers.
# The decision to release software should remain in the hands of those who own the softwareâ€”the business people.
# The purpose of CI is to decouple technical concerns (can we test that our latest changes work together)
# from business concerns by keeping the software in an always-shippable state where the latest features *could*
# be released if the business so chose.
