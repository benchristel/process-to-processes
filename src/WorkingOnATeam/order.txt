# thinking of software "projects" lead to gold-plating and scope creep
# - "we might not get another chance so we have to make it perfect now!"
# - if you react to projects this way, you are rewarding the organization for bad behavior
# - just do the project and don't let scope creep. If people are dissatisfied with the results, advocate for incremental dev.

# CI does NOT mean you are constantly releasing new software to users/customers.
# The decision to release software should remain in the hands of those who own the softwareâ€”the business people.
# The purpose of CI is to decouple technical concerns (can we test that our latest changes work together)
# from business concerns by keeping the software in an always-shippable state where the latest features *could*
# be released if the business so chose.
