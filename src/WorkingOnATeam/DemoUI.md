# Technique: Demo UI

<div class="summary-block">

Forces:

- stakeholders are often nervous about software teams not delivering. They want to see what they're getting for their money.
- programmers need to continually test their work-in-progress user interfacesâ€”{{link ManualUITesting}} to get a feel for what needs to change.
- it is possible to build polished-looking demos to show to stakeholders. But there is a risk that these will then be put into production,
  and create huge headaches and slowdowns for the team later.

Therefore: build rough demos inside a {{link MakingApp}} so you can show off your work and test it more easily.
