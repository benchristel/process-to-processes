# Technique: Canonical Library

Within a {{link TesseractOrganization}} scheme, curate a set of "canonical" app-agnostic and infra modules. By "canonical," I mean that new programmers joining the project should familiarize themselves with the APIs of these modules and understand how to use them.

A canonical library allows an application to be written in a consistent idiom, at a level of abstraction somewhat higher (and better suited to the application) than what the language and its standard library provide.
