# About This Book

This book is about how to make software that:

- is much better for its users and makers than industry-average software
- costs no more (and possibly a lot less)

The ideas in the book are not especially complicated or arcane. Any programmer can master them. Only two things are required:

- You have to practice. Reading this book is probably not going to be sufficient.
- You're going to need the right half of your brain. As you practice, you'll encounter many situations where it's not clear what the right thing to do is. You'll need to resolve these uncertainties by deferring to your sense of what feels right for the situation. As you live with the results of your decisions, this sense will improve.

## Topics

- _**Part I: Programming**_ is about, well, programming—which in my book includes software design, testing, architecture, documentation—everything required to write bug-free, maintainable code on a budget. _Programming_ is the first part of the book because it's the foundation of everything we do. Our job, ultimately, boils down to getting computers to do what we want in a way that doesn't cost a fortune. Although software design is, [as Kent Beck points out](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/coming-soon), an exercise in human relationships, relationships are founded on trust. Programmers earn trust by reliably delivering working software.
- _**Part II: Working With Others**_ explores how to maintain and build human relationships around software once the initial level of trust is earned. It describes communication patterns and team dynamics that are good for the whole system—people _and_ code, employees _and_ customers.
- _**Part III: User Interfaces**_ discusses the principles behind user interface design. There is a shortage of UI and UX designers in the software industry of 2023, and programmers are often called upon to make design decisions. This part of the book tries to ensure that the designs we produce will be comfortable and straightforward to use for the people who have to use them.
- _**Part IV: The Tao of Software Development**_ goes back to the original software consultant's manual, the _Dào Dé Jīng_, or "Book of the Way and Virtue", written 2500 years ago in China by an unknown author. While the details of software have changed much in the last two millennia, people have stayed approximately the same, so there is plenty of applicable wisdom in this venerable text. In this part of the book, we'll see that even the humblest aspects of programming contain profound insights into the nature of our universe and ourselves. The practical and the mystical will be fused, as if by lightning.


















My thesis is that enormous gains in software quality could be had for essentially no net cost—*if* everyone involved in making software had the requisite knowledge. That's a big if, but this book is my attempt to put a dent in the knowledge problem.

Furthermore, I claim that the knowledge that will enable this improvement to happen is:

- not complicated—you don't need a Ph. D to understand it.
- not new
- mostly not "left-brain" type stuff
- almost incomprehensible within the current technocratic paradigm of Western thought.

In this book, we will be looking at simple, tried-and-true ideas in software development. We will discuss values, aesthetics, communication, and the relationship between the maker and the made.

The ideas in this book build on each other, often in surprising ways. The cumulative result will be a paradigm shift. You'll be able to see your code and your work in a whole new way, and that way of seeing will make you very effective.

The ultimate purpose of software (or any other human activity) ought to be the **well-being of people**. This book will show you how to make software in a way that contributes to that purpose.

By "people", I mean _everyone_. In this book, I will give special attention to the users and makers of software, but we will also consider how software might affect people who don't directly use it.

By "well-being" I mean _all aspects_ of well-being: physical, mental, emotional, relational, aesthetic, spiritual. You might be able to think of others. I mean to include them all. An expansive definition of well-being is necessary because interactions with software take up an increasing portion of our daily lives. More and more of our civilization runs on software. That means that if software is a bit broken, society is a bit broken. If software is ugly and unpleasant, then our environment is ugly and unpleasant. We can't afford to overlook any of software's potential harms.

Looking on the bright side: software's integration into society means we can use it as a lever to improve the *whole* system. **By changing the parts in the right way, we can make the whole better**—a theme to which this book will continually return.

## What Makes Software Good for Users?

If we are trying to contribute to the well-being of our software's users, what intermediate goals might we aim for?

- No bugs, glitches, or other unpleasant surprises
- Accessibility
- Performance
- A straightforward user experience
- Comprehensible controls and information displays

None of this should be controversial or surprising; I list these topics merely as a preview of the content of the book. All of these things should be table stakes for any software application; the fact that most software is flawed in most of these categories does not speak well of the software industry.
