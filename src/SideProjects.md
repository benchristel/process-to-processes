# Technique: Side Projects

_a way to experiment with different programming styles, and get in touch with your true feelings about them._

I strongly recommend that you work on projects outside of work. Ideally, projects where:

- The codebase is somewhat complex—at least a couple thousand lines
- You are solely responsible for the code
- You will maintain and improve the code over a long period of time—ideally years
- No one else is going to see or care about how the code looks

These projects have a twofold purpose. The first purpose is obviously to give you a place to practice programming. A personal project is an environment where it's safe to make mistakes, and you can explore and experiment freely.

The second, less obvious purpose is to put you in touch with how you actually feel about different programming styles.

Maintaining code that you wrote over a long period of time, where you have no one else to blame and no one to impress, really brings you face to face with the realities of your own work habits and programming style. You will probably learn:

- A lot of the time pressure you feel at work is self-imposed. It comes from your own impatience, not from your manager or coworkers.
- The code you prefer to read looks very different from the code you think you "should" write.
- Your actual coding style is different from the style you publicly espouse
- When you begin a project aiming for "perfection", the result feels awkward and contorted.

This process of self-discovery is frustrating and humbling at first. But it leads ultimately to peace, because you eventually realize that when you are in touch with your feelings about the code, you can relax. Instead of tenaciously pursuing idealistic images of how things "should" be,
and building castles on sand, you can simply fix the problems that _really_ exist, and are _really_ important to you, one at a time. You'll be open to many more ways of doing things, and won't feel the need to put down anyone else's programming style,
because you'll see that everything is a good idea in its proper context.
