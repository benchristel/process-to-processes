# In a Healthy Organization, No One Cares About Estimates

- Implementing a single incremental feature, with known, appropriate technology and a fixed scope, should be doable on any reasonable schedule. Software _should_ be able to move faster than other functions (marketing, support), and so not block release.

- Implementing a _software systems product_ (Brooks' term) requires iteration and user research, and so the scope cannot be known in advance. New technologies may need to be developed, too. Fixing a time and scope before any development begins is ludicrous.
