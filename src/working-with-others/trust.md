# Trust

Programmers build trust with other people in a variety of ways:

- Steadily improving on the software, without introducing problems
- Providing feedback about the likely cost and risks of proposed changes
- Understanding the domain, not just the code. Communicating in terms of things that others value (features, cost, bugs, timelines, risk, security, UX), not technical details.
