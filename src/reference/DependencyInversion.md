The **Dependency inversion principle** is the "D" of [[SOLID]]. It states,

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on [[Abstraction]]s.

An "abstraction", here, is kind of like an agreed-upon protocol or [[Contract]] that governs the interaction between modules. It describes the shape of any data exchanged and the effects of various operations.
