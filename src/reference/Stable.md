[[RobertCMartin]], in [Design Principles and Design Patterns](https://wnmurphy.com/assets/pdf/Robert_C._Martin_-_2000_-_Principles_and_Patterns.pdf), defines the **instability** of a software [[Component]] as `fan-out / (fan-in + fan-out)`. Fan-in is also called [[AfferentCoupling]] (the number of callers of our component) and fan-out is also called [[EfferentCoupling]] (the number of concepts our component knows about, i.e. depends on).

An instable software component is easy to change, and may be risky to rely on (since its high fan-out means it can be broken by many other possible changes). A stable software component may be risky or difficult to change because so many things depend on it, but is safe to rely on.

It's important to realize that there is no particular value judgment attached to stability or instability _per se_. Some parts of software, like the high-level [[Policy]], should be easily changeable and thus instable. Other parts, like [[Mechanism]], should be stable.
