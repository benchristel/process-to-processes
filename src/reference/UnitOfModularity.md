A "unit of modularity" comprises [[Variable]]s and the [[Routine]]s that operate on them.

A unit of modularity has a boundary separating its inside from its outside. Usually, not everything inside the boundary can be [[Reference]]d from outside.

Examples include:

- a [[Module]]
- an [[Object]]
- a [[Class]]
