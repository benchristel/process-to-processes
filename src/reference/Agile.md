The **[Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/)** reads, in its entirety:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

It was signed by the following people:

Concluding:

> Â© 2001, the above authors

The signatories never convened again. Whatever people tell you about "Agile", its *only* canonical description is the Manifesto.
