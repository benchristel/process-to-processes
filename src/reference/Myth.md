A myth, in the good sense, is a story about who we are and what we ought to be doing. By "story" I do not mean necessarily a narrative with a beginning, middle, and end, but a web of relationships between people, things, and concepts that is often too nonlinear to be fully explicated. A shared myth is an essential and perhaps inescapable part of any culture. Myths are how we orient ourselves relative to the world.

For example, one myth of programming is that the programmer is an elite hacker/wizard who understands the machine so deeply that they can (and should) manipulate it into doing anything they want. This myth views programming as a discrete and solitary act. A program is written all at once, by one person, for perhaps only one machine; it is perfect at conception and is never revisited. The <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html">story of Mel</a> is the earliest example of poetry I could find from this culture. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">Demoscene</a> is perhaps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_culture">material culture</a> of an offshoot of this myth.

In the bad sense, a myth is a popularly believed falsehood, e.g. "the myth that unit tests prove correctness". There is some overlap between the senses. For example, I doubt whether the hacker/wizard myth of programming is realistic. Even in the days when single people did write monolithic programs for single machines, my impression is that it took a lot of thought and trial and error.

While perhaps not strictly correct, I will use the word _mythology_ to denote the good sense of "myth".
