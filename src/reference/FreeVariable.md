The free variables (or, more precisely, the free [[Identifier]]s) of a [[Routine]] are those that are referenced within the [[Routine]] but not declared as locals or [[Parameters]]. In most programming languages, the definitions of free [[Identifer]]s are looked up in the [[Routine]]'s enclosing [[LexicalScope]].
