Compare this quote from the page on [[TestDrivenDevelopment]]: "Code is a hypothesis about how to solve a problem". That is, it's a record of what we've learned so far about how to solve that problem.

## Figuring out what to do

Framing software development as "learning" is perhaps too vague. A better framing might be that the hard part of software development is _figuring out what the right thing to do is_. This might involve learning about technologies, or about the domain. It might involve trying different approaches. It might involve lying in a hammock and pondering what's _actually_ important to the system we're building.
