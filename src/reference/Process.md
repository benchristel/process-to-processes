A process, in computing, is a computer's representation of an ongoing computation. A process is associated with a sequence of instructions to be executed (the [[Program]]), some notion of the "current" instruction within that sequence, and possibly some [[State]] that the computer uses as "scratch space" to perform the computation.

More generally, a process is a sequence of events in [[Time]], governed by a [[State]] and a set of rules that lets us obtain the next state from the current one.

## Software development process

Software is developed by a process according to the more general definition above; the code is state that evolves over [[DevelopmentTime]]. The software doesn't emerge fully-formed from our brains, nor could it. As [[ChristopherAlexander]] points out in [[NotesOnTheSynthesisOfForm]]:
