The principle of convexity tells you how to clearly distinguish between figure and ground. Figures have convex outlines.

## Examples

The rounded ends of Apple's scrollbar thumbs clearly distinguish them as figures against the ground of the scrollbar track.

## Negative Examples

If the scrollbar thumb is rectangular, it can be hard to tell which rectangle is the thumb and which is the track. Example from https://codepen.io/mariaklara/pen/bJjjLY / https://onaircode.com/html-css-custom-scrollbar-examples/
