Idea Fragments are a code smell identified by [[KatrinaOwen]] in her article ["What's in a Name? Anti-Patterns to a Hard Problem"].(https://www.sitepoint.com/whats-in-a-name-anti-patterns-to-a-hard-problem/)

Salient quote from the article:

> When each method represents a fragment of a concept, the solution becomes incomprehensible.
