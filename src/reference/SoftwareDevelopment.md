Software development is the process by which software teams are organized, and the software itself is conceived, designed, built, tested, and made available to users. It contrasts with [[SoftwareEngineering]], which focuses solely on the technical aspects of design, construction, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Software development is undertaken by [[Developer]]s. A developer, in my personal jargon, is not necessarily a [[Programmer]]â€”the term includes anyone who contributes expertise or labor to the software development process.

There are several popular [[Methodologies|Methodology]] for developing software:

- [[Waterfall]] (not intended to be taken seriously)
- [[ExtremeProgramming]]
- [[Scrum]]
- [[Lean]]
- [[ProgrammerAnarchy]]

Note that [[Agile]] is not a methodology, as many assume. Rather, it's a set of [[PhilosophicalValue]]s.
