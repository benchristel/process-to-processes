The Principle of Distinction says that UI elements with different behaviors or roles should look different. The visual language should not contain "homomorphs"—i.e. distinct lexemes with indistinguishable forms.

## Negative Examples

Here is an example where the principle of distinction was not adequately followed: I mistook this purple rectangle next to a list item for a scrollbar thumb. It actually marks the selected tab.

Any one of several small changes could have prevented the mistake:

- the tabs could have been given top and bottom borders, which would make it clear that the purple bar coincides with a tab.
- the active tab could have been given a distinct background color instead of or in addition to the purple bar
- a different shape could have been used to mark the active tab—e.g. a dot or an arrow
- UI designers all over the world could have avoided habituating users to tiny, rectangular, non-platform-standard scrollbar thumbs and invisible scrollbar tracks.
