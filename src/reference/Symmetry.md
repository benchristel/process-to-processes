Michael Mehaffy points out that classical architects had a much more complex and nuanced view of symmetry than simplistic bilateral symmetry. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE_MHZu0Qmk

In [[Code]], translational and scaling symmetries are the most interesting. Bilateral symmetry occurs mainly in trivial/uninteresting cases, like matched parentheses or `open` and `close` operations on files.
