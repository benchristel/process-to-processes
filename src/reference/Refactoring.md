[[MartinFowler]] coined the term "refactoring". You can read more about it on https://refactoring.com/.

"Refactoring" gets used as both a verb and a noun:

As a verb: to _refactor_ code is to alter its internal structure without changing its externally-visible behavior. The focus of refactoring is on making code easier to understand and change.

As a noun: a _refactoring_ is a single, small, atomic, reversible, behavior-preserving change to the structure of code. These refactorings have names: _Extract Variable_, _Extract Function_, _Change Value to Reference_, _Replace Query With Parameter_.... Martin Fowler named 66 refactorings ([listed on his website](https://refactoring.com/catalog/)). I've identified [a few more](https://github.com/benchristel/refactoring-workshop/tree/master/docs/refactorings).
