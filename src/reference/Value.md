**NOTE:** A previous version of this page had a different definition of "value". I've reassigned that meaning to the word [Datum](Data). Sorry for any confusion.

A **value** is something that you can assign to a [[BoundName]] (e.g. it can appear on the right-hand side of a variable assignment). [[Data]], [[Object]]s, and [[Closure]]s are all examples of values.
