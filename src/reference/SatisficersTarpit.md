I just generally struggle to re-engage with Druthers as a project.

**Ben Christel:**<br>
fair enough. Maybe you've moved on

**Gavin Morgan:**<br>
The problem is that it works well enough for my purposes.
I used it with three total strangers, yesterday, in a pickup Cortex RPG session.
We voted on genres to set the game in, and did a mashup of the top three.

**Ben Christel:**<br>
ah yes. We need a name for this part of the project...
"the satisficer's tarpit"

**Gavin Morgan:**<br>
I had to explain a) you can drag them, b) up is good, c) yes, you've already voted and are continuously voting.
But then, you know, it worked.

**Ben Christel:**<br>
[[PhilGoodwin]] once said to me that once he sees how something can be completed, completing it becomes much less interesting.

**Gavin Morgan:**<br>
I am the same. Wow.

**Ben Christel:**<br>
Me too

**Gavin Morgan:**<br>
Sometimes, once I figure out a hard problem, I will literally stand up and walk away from the computer.
Before implementing it. üòÄ
"Ah! That's how to do it."
‚úåÔ∏èüö∂
I thought this was a good thing or, like, a necessary focus-preserving tactic.

**Ben Christel:**<br>
the meditative grind of actually finishing the now-boring thing is a skill, too
the point of refactoring and design and tests, after all, is to make the rest of the project uninteresting

**Gavin Morgan:**<br>
I think the way out of "the satisficer's tarpit" is __customers__.
Because they are not satisfied.

**Ben Christel:**<br>
yep
