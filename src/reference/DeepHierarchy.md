**Deep hierarchies** are a [[FormalProperty]] of [[DeathlikeMorphology]]. The opposite is a [[ShallowHierarchy]].

Deeply nested data, control flow, dependency graphs, call stacks, and corporate management structures all lead to rigid, brittle systems that can only be kept alive by extreme heroics.

The reason: long-distance coordination between levels of the hierarchy (or between distant cousin nodes; see [1]) couples together many more entities than would need to be coupled in a shallow hierarchy. Each layer of indirection provides opportunities for mistakes and misinterpretation of information.

The opposite is a [[ShallowHierarchy]].
