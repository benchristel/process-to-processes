[[MichaelFeathers]] says that code without tests is legacy code.

[[KevlinHenney]] says that a common property of legacy systems is that they are BIG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3b4tremI5o

However, I prefer a more extreme definition:

**If you're reading code, it's legacy code.**

If you need to *read* the code (as opposed to glancing or skimming) to understand it, figure out if you should change it, etc. the [[DreamOfEngineeringMastery]] has failed you. Rather than building steadily and incrementally on your existing abilities, you're taking a step back to revisit something you thought was "done".

Legacy code is inevitable. But we can try to minimize it.
