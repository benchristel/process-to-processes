PEBCAK is an acronym for "Problem existing (or exists) between chair and keyboard"â€”I.e. "the user goofed something up."

While the concept of "user error" doesn't sit well with me (software should be built to serve the user, so if the software does something that the user doesn't expect, the software, not the user, is the first suspect to be interrogated), [[AllToolsAreParsers]] and thus it is necessary for the user to have an accurate mental model of what the software is doing; otherwise they _will_ encounter problems they don't know how to fix.

Also variously rendered PEBKAC.
