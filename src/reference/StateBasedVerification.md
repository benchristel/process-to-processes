State-based verification is a [[SoftwareTesting]] technique that involves making [[Assertion]]s about the [[State]] of [[Object]]s (usually, probing the state of an object involves calling its [[Method]]s). The objects being asserted about may be the [[SystemUnderTest]] or [[Fake]]s. The technique contrasts with [[MessageBasedVerification]].
