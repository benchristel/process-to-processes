A **[[Software]] [[System]]** is a set of communicating [[Component]]s (which may be [[Process]]es, [[Service]]s, [[Device]]s, or people), in which some of the components are software.

[Kent Beck notes that a software system is "people & computers together"](https://www.mechanical-orchard.com/post/features-and-design-why-not-both).
