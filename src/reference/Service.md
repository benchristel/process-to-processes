A service is a [[Component]] of a [[SoftwareSystem]] that is relatively high-scoped and long-lived, and possibly [[State]]ful. E.g. from the perspective of [[Process]]es in the system, a service is typically [[Global]], accessible at some discoverable or [[WellKnown]] location (like a URL), and exists forever, preserving its [[State]] indefinitely.

## Examples

The quintessential example of a service these days is arguably a web service with a REST API. But services don't need to live on the web. The filesystem on your computer is also a service by the definition above, as are other OS services like the clock and window system.
