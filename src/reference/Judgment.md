# Judgment

The [Judgment Premise](
https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/12/22/the-judgment-premise/) is one of [[GeePawHill]]'s [five underplayed premises of TDD](https://www.geepawhill.org/2018/01/18/five-underplayed-premises-of-tdd-2/)

He phrases it a few different ways, but the gist is:

> We are inevitably, perpetually, and _happily_ reliant on human judgment for every step we take during [[TestDrivenDevelopment]].

In other words, TDD isn't an algorithm for coding that you can apply mechanically: turn the crank and working software comes out. You have to think, and more than that, you have to be _wise_. You need, at the least, empathy, foresight, humility, good taste, and a sense for which risks are worth taking.

## Responsibility

Judgment and responsibility are two sides of the same coin.

When we attribute decisions to something other than judgment (e.g. the "rules" or "best practices" we've received from others) we are passing the buck. We can blame the rules, not ourselves, for any problems that result from the decision.
