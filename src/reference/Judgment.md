The [Judgment Premise](
https://www.geepawhill.org/2020/12/22/the-judgment-premise/) is one of [[GeePawHill]]'s [five underplayed premises of TDD](https://www.geepawhill.org/2018/01/18/five-underplayed-premises-of-tdd-2/)

He phrases it a few different ways, but the gist is:

> We are inevitably, perpetually, and _happily_ reliant on human judgment for every step we take during [[TestDrivenDevelopment]].

In other words, TDD isn't an algorithm for coding that you can apply mechanically: turn the crank and working software comes out. You have to think, and more than that, you have to be _wise_. You need, at the least, empathy, foresight, humility, good taste, and a sense for which risks are worth taking.
