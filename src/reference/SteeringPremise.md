The Steering Premise (so named by [[GeePawHill]]) makes explicit the idea that [[TestDrivenDevelopment]] should change the way you structure your code. https://www.geepawhill.org/2017/07/15/the-driven-premise/

I'd argue for the Steering Premise along the following lines:

- If a tool or technique doesn't change the way you work, it's worse than useless: a cost with no benefit. The very _purpose_ of a tool is to change the way you work—to enable you to accomplish goals more effectively, more cheaply, etc.
- Code is not the product of your work—working software is. The code is (part of) the means of producing software.
- Therefore, changes to the structure of your code are changes to how you work.
