[[Programmer]]s underuse prepositions in [[Identifier]]s, sometimes with disastrous effects for intelligibility.

Dave Thomas, speaking about the Manifesto for [[Agile]] Software Development, [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M),

> We were careful to call it "The Manifesto for Agile Software Development". That's what it says on the website. But that's not what people call it. People call it "The Agile Manifesto". And this is the root of all the evil that has followed. Because "agile" is an *adjective*. If you mean to talk about a manifesto for agile software development, it's not an "agile manifesto". The best you can do is "agility manifesto" or something ugly like that.

Note that `ManifestoForAgileSoftwareDevelopment` contains a preposition, while `AgileManifesto` does not. English has prepositions because *they convey important information* about the relationship between nouns. We ought to use them.
