The maximum time a UI should take to respond to input from its user is 400ms.

In 1982, Walter Doherty and Ahrvind Thadani [discovered](https://jlelliotton.blogspot.com/p/the-economic-value-of-rapid-response.html) that shortening computer response times to 400 milliseconds (from the accepted standard of 2 seconds) resulted in a disproportionately large improvement in productivity. When people no longer had to wait for the machine, they typed commands faster and spent much less time collecting their thoughts.
