Excerpts from [Stephen Mitchell's translation](https://terebess.hu/english/tao/mitchell.html) of the _Dào Dé Jīng_ that I think are especially relevant for programming.

> The ancient Masters were profound and subtle.<br/>
> Their wisdom was unfathomable.<br/>
> There is no way to describe it;<br/>
> all we can describe is their appearance.<br/>
>
> They were careful<br/>
> as someone crossing an iced-over stream.<br/>
> Alert as a warrior in enemy territory.<br/>
> Courteous as a guest.<br/>
> Fluid as melting ice.<br/>
> Shapable as a block of wood.<br/>
> Receptive as a valley.<br/>
> Clear as a glass of water.<br/>
>
> Do you have the patience to wait<br/>
> till your mud settles and the water is clear?<br/>
> Can you remain unmoving<br/>
> till the right action arises by itself?<br/>
>
> The Master doesn't seek fulfillment.<br/>
> Not seeking, not expecting,<br/>
> she is present, and can welcome all things.<br/>

> When the Master governs, the people<br/>
> are hardly aware that he exists.<br/>
> Next best is a leader who is loved.<br/>
> Next, one who is feared.<br/>
> The worst is one who is despised.
>
> If you don't trust the people,<br/>
> you make them untrustworthy.
>
> The Master doesn't talk, he acts.<br/>
> When his work is done,<br/>
> the people say, "Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!" 

> When you have names and forms,<br/>
> know that they are provisional.<br/>
> When you have institutions,<br/>
> know where their functions should end.<br/>
> Knowing when to stop,<br/>
> you can avoid any danger.

> In pursuit of knowledge,<br/>
> every day something is added.<br/>
> In the practice of the Tao,<br/>
> every day something is dropped.<br/>
> Less and less do you need to force things,<br/>
> until finally you arrive at non-action.<br/>
> When nothing is [being] done,<br/>
> nothing is left undone.<br/>

> Act without doing;<br/>
> work without effort.<br/>
> Think of the small as large<br/>
> and the few as many.<br/>
> Confront the difficult<br/>
> while it is still easy;<br/>
> accomplish the great task<br/>
> by a series of small acts.<br/>
>
> The Master never reaches for the great;<br/>
> thus she achieves greatness.<br/>
> When she runs into a difficulty,<br/>
> she stops and gives herself to it.<br/>
> She doesn't cling to her own comfort;<br/>
> thus problems are no problem for her.<br/>
> 
> What is rooted is easy to nourish.<br/>
> What is recent is easy to correct.<br/>
> What is brittle is easy to break.<br/>
> What is small is easy to scatter.<br/>
>
> Prevent trouble before it arises.<br/>
> Put things in order before they exist.<br/>
> The giant pine tree<br/>
> grows from a tiny sprout.<br/>
> The journey of a thousand miles<br/>
> starts from beneath your feet.<br/>
>
> Rushing into action, you fail.<br/>
> Trying to grasp things, you lose them.<br/>
> Forcing a project to completion,<br/>
> you ruin what was almost ripe.<br/>
>
> Therefore the Master takes action<br/>
> by letting things take their course.<br/>
> He remains as calm<br/>
> at the end as at the beginning.<br/>

> When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.<br/>
> Having realized it, he admits it.<br/>
> Having admitted it, he corrects it.<br/>
> He considers those who point out his faults<br/>
> as his most benevolent teachers.<br/>
> He thinks of his enemy<br/>
> as the shadow that he himself casts.<br/>

> The ancient Masters<br/>
> didn't try to educate the people,<br/>
> but kindly taught them to not-know.<br/>
>
> When they think that they know the answers,<br/>
> people are difficult to guide.<br/>
> When they know that they don't know,<br/>
> people can find their own way.<br/>

> If a country is governed wisely,<br/>
> its inhabitants will be content.<br/>
> They enjoy the labor of their hands<br/>
> and don't waste time inventing<br/>
> labor-saving machines.<br/>
> Since they dearly love their homes,<br/>
> they aren't interested in travel.<br/>
> There may be a few wagons and boats,<br/>
> but these don't go anywhere.<br/>
> There may be an arsenal of weapons,<br/>
> but nobody ever uses them.<br/>
> People enjoy their food,<br/>
> take pleasure in being with their families,<br/>
> spend weekends working in their gardens,<br/>
> delight in the doings of the neighborhood.<br/>
> And even though the next country is so close<br/>
> that people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking,<br/>
> they are content to die of old age<br/>
> without ever having gone to see it.<br/>
