# Who Should Read This Book

_Process to Processes_ is addressed to professional software developers with at least a year or two of experience in application development.

The code examples are mostly in JavaScript and TypeScript. However, the programming ideas in the book apply across languages. Specifically, they apply to the extent that your language supports:

- An interpreter or fast, incremental compiler
- Higher-order first-class functions
- Some degree of late-binding (e.g. dynamic dispatch, function pointers, mutability)
- Algebraic types
- A sane package manager for installing dependencies
- Coroutines or generator functions
- Exceptions

If you work primarily in a language that lacks most of these features, proceed with caution.
