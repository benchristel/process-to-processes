# Who Should Read This Book

_Process to Processes_ is addressed to professional software developers with at least a year or two of experience in application development.

The code examples are mostly in JavaScript and TypeScript. However, the programming ideas in the book apply across languages. Specifically, they apply to the extent that your language supports:

- An interpreter or fast, incremental compiler
- Higher-order first-class functions
- Some degree of late-binding (e.g. dynamic dispatch, function pointers, mutability)
- A convenient, performant implementation of immutable data structures
- Algebraic types
- A sane package manager for installing dependencies
- Coroutines or generator functions
- Exceptions

I have successfully applied the techniques in this book in Ruby, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Scala, and C++.
If you work in a language very different from any of these, proceed with caution.
