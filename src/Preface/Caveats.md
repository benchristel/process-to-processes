## I Have No Grand Unified Theory

As you read through the chapters in this book—especially the {{link 36Views Views}} in first section, on {{link SoftwareDevelopment/index.html SoftwareDevelopment}}—you will probably have trouble piecing them together. It may be hard to see what I'm driving at. "What's the big picture?" you'll wonder. "What is his grand unified theory of software development?"

I have no grand theory. I don't believe there can be one. All I have are enough different ways to look at software systems that I can build ad-hoc mental models of the *actual systems that are in front of me*, and that is enough. My goal is not to "solve" software development, but simply to create good software. I don't need a grand unified theory for that.

Therefore, as you read the chapters, don't worry too much about fitting them together. Instead, try to relate each one to your own experience. The sooner you can get a feel for how my views and techniques play out in the real world, the sooner you will be able to apply them effectively.
