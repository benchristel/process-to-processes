Software production takes place within a vast system of many interacting parts, including people and computers. These interactions can be contentious, fraught with strife, miscommunication, and mistakes. Improving the system means iteratively repairing the "impedance mismatches" that cause  bad interactions. We know our improvements have succeeded when people are kind to each other, and own & care for their environment.

Healthy systems create healthy software. Healthy software, in turn, helps keep the system healthy.

The improvement process must be made self-sustaining, or you'll burn out. You must therefore create a virtuous cycle of improvement. That cycle is kindled by relationships of mutual trust. People trust programmers when they deliver results; therefore, if you are a programmer, start by honing these skills: **test-driven and type-driven design, refactoring, and communication**.
