# Summary of the book in 128 words

I tried to write a book about how to make better software. Then I realized that the only way to make software better is to make the world better. So here we are.

Software inhabits a vast system of many interacting parts, including people and machines. Improving the system means iteratively repairing "impedance mismatches" between its parts. Successful "improvement" looks like people being kind to each other, and owning & caring for their environment.

The improvement process must be made self-sustaining, or you'll burn out. You must therefore create a virtuous cycle of improvement. That cycle is kindled by relationships of mutual trust. People trust programmers when they deliver results; therefore, if you are a programmer, start by honing these skills: **test-driven and type-driven design, refactoring, and communication**.
