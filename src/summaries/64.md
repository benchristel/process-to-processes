# Summary of the book in 64 words

Iteratively repair "impedance mismatches" between parts of your system, including people and machines. Seek fast feedback.

**To sustain this process, you must create a virtuous cycle of improvement. That cycle starts with relationships of mutual trust. People trust programmers when they deliver results; therefore, hone your technical skills.**

Success is when people are kind to each other, and own & care for their environment.
