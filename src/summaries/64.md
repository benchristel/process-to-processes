# Summary of the book in 64 words

Iteratively repair "impedance mismatches" between parts of your system, including people and machines. Seek fast feedback.

**To sustain this process, you must create a virtuous cycle of improvement. That cycle is kindled by relationships of mutual trust. People trust programmers when they deliver results; therefore, hone your skills.**

Success looks like people being kind to each other, and owning & caring for their environment.
