# Summary of the book in 256 words

I tried to write a book for programmers about how to make better software. Then I realized that the only way to make software better is to make the world better. So here we are.

Software inhabits a vast system of many interacting parts, including people and machines. Improving the *whole system* is both the motive and the method for improving software.

To improve a system, we start by removing the friction, waste, and suffering that occur when different parts with *mismatched behaviors or interfaces* communicate. Examples of mismatches:

- a bug in software is a mismatch between the software's behavior and its users' expectations.
- when a user interface requires too many clicks to do a common task, that's a mismatch between the software and the user's needs.
- when a bureaucratic process isn't helping anyone, there's a mismatch between the process and the people involved.

Fixing a mismatch always means improving the **interaction** by changing the **parts**. Sometimes, we change the behavior of an existing part; sometimes we add or remove parts.

The measure of the system's health is the degree to which people are kind to each other, and own & care for their environment.

The improvement process must be made self-sustaining, or you'll burn out. You must therefore create a virtuous cycle of improvement. That cycle is kindled by relationships of mutual trust. People trust programmers when they deliver results; therefore, if you are a programmer, start by honing these skills: **test-driven and type-driven design, refactoring, and communication**.
