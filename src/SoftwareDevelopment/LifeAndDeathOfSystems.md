# View: Living Systems, Dying Systems

- Systems can be stable (self-sustaining) or unstable (prone to collapse or replacement)
    - Caveat: instability of the parts sometimes contributes to stability of the whole!
      - Examples: economics (competition means firms that can't compete go out of business, but the market is more efficient), evolution (because individuals die, the species can survive and adapt in a changing environment)

Being stuck in a dying system is no fun!
