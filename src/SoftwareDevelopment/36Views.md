# Technique: 36 Views

<div class="summary-block">

How do we make sense of a complex software system?

How can we communicate our understanding to others?

</div>

The "36 Views" technique is a way to make sense of a complex topic, by approaching it from many different, complementary angles.

The name is a reference to the series of paintings ["36 Views of Mount Fuji"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji) by Hokusai.

In this book, I use the 36 Views technique to investigate complex topics. Each view illuminates some aspect of the topic while obscuring others.

There is an analogy to be made to [multiview projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiview_projection), in which a multidimensional object is presented via several projections into a lower-dimensional space.

See also: Mike Caulfield's idea of [Choral Explanations](https://hapgood.us/2016/05/13/choral-explanations/), and [Bohr's principle of complementarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(physics)).

## Views Versus Models

A _mental model_ is a holistic understanding of a system. Mental models are what allow us to make predictions about the future. They let us simulate the system in our heads, and imagine what it will do in response to some outside stimulus or change.

A weakness of mental models is that they can never be fully explicated or communicated from person to person—a point that Peter Naur makes well in his essay ["Programming as Theory Building."](https://gwern.net/doc/cs/algorithm/1985-naur.pdf) He uses the word **theory** where I use "mental model", but it's the same idea.

Indeed, I would go so far as to say that a mental model is not _built_, but _grown_. It is rooted in a particular mind, developed through the interaction of that mind with the world, and can never be moved.

Because we can't directly communicate our mental models to each other, we need views. Views are more teachable than mental models—we can explain how to obtain them, draw pictures representing them, and so forth. The downside of views is that they are not, in themselves, predictive of events in the world, and no single view presents a comprehensive picture of the system it describes. But by combining many complementary views together, we can form working mental models much more easily.
