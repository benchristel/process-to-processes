# View: Humans, Not Humanoids

In "Making Badass Developers", Kathy Sierra draws a distinction between:

- Humans: fallible, with extremely scarce, easily depleted cognitive resources
- Humanoids: perfect, untiring reasoning machines

Everyone you work with is a human. The users of your software are humans. Your bosses are humans. Their bosses are humans.

Yet we tend to treat anyone from whom we're even a little bit distant as if they're a humanoid. We assume that they'll remember all relevant facts, deduce the right conclusions from the information available to them, search all solution paths without bias, and respond unemotionally to input. We think that if they forget something, or fail to draw "obvious" conclusions from the information in front of them, or are unwilling to follow "the process" or use the tools available to them, that it's _their_ problemâ€”a personal problem.

Yet it can't be a personal problem, because everyone has these same "faults". It is absurd that we have built corporate and technogical systems that fail to accommodate the universally-shared limitations of the people who maintain and inhabit them. Yet, that is, for the most part, exactly what we've done.

Watch Kathy's talk. It's well worth your time.
