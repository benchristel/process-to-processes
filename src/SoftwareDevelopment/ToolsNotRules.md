# Tools, Not Rules

There is no right way to program. There are only ways that are better or worse in different circumstances, and circumstances change all the time. The circumstance of solving a problem you've never solved before is different from the circumstance of communicating your thoughts to someone else, which is different from the circumstance of making your app scale to a million users. All these circumstances require different types of code.

What this means for you is that you can stop trying to come up with perfect designs. There's no such thing. So relax! {{link MakeItRunMakeItRight}}. Do a thing, and then ask yourself how it could be better. Realizing your work could be better is not failureâ€”not even temporary failure. This is how the masters code.
