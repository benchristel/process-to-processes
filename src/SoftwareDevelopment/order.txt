# development as computation:
# - garbage collection - finding/deleting unused code / outdated artifacts is an important subproblem
# - search - we can conceptualize dev as a search in a solution space.
#   a common search strategy is to try many hypothetical/possible solutions and see what works out

LifeAndDeathOfSystems.md
# - Systems can be stable (self-sustaining) or unstable (prone to collapse or replacement)
#    - Caveat: instability of the parts sometimes contributes to stability of the whole!
#      - Examples: economics (competition means firms that can't compete go out of business,
#        but the market is more efficient), evolution (because individuals die, the species can
#        survive and adapt in a changing environment)

InformationFlow.md
# - As info flows through a system, it drives the parts of the system to move
# - certain motions are accommodated by the structure of the system, and are easy.
# - Other motions are resisted by the structure of the system. When this resistance
#   touches humans, we experience it as discomfort/pain.
# - The system's response to pain is long-term/plastic change. We suffer to the degree
#   that changes in response to pain are obstructed.

Techniques.md
# - a technique solves a problem in a situation
# - context-dependent - use your judgment about when to apply
# - Principle: Judgment
# - TODO: rename to "pattern" or something else?

BalancedWork.md
# - the purpose of much of software engineering is to make the work straightforward and
#   unexciting - i.e. to turn creative exploration into slog
# - over-automation can make working on a codebase boring, which leads to alienation,
#   inattentiveness, and mistakes. It's not actually sustainable!
# - maintain a healthy balance between exploration and slog.
# - some programmers prefer one type of work or the other... rotate programmers at
#   different phases of the product lifecycle?
