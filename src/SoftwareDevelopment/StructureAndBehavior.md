# View: Structure and Behavior

**Software** is structure that has behavior.

By "structure" I mean the web of relationships that you see if you look inside the softwareâ€”at the code and the running {{link SoftwareProcess processes}} instantiated from it.

By "behavior", I mean _what the software does_, as far as anyone outside it can tell. {{link Feature}}s are behavior we like; {{link Bug}}s are behavior we don't. {{link ExternalSoftwareQuality}} is a property of behavior.

Structure is what programmers create, but behavior is what software companies can sell. There seems, therefore, to be a {{link Conflict}} between structure and behavior. Employers want the most valuable behavior they can get, and the most economical structure that will provide it.

And yet, structure and behavior are two sides of the same coin. We don't get one without the other. So we need to find a way to resolve the conflict: to make these two aspects of software harmonize with each other. That is what this book is about.
