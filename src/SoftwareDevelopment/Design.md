**Design** is the art of resolving conflicts between forces. By shaping and arranging centers in the right way, it is often possible to turn a situation of conflict into one of harmony and agreement.

Good designs often seem to come from a flash of inspiration or insight. While it may never be possible to reach a good design solely by following mechanical rules, design is a learnable skill. Designers learn by formulating and applying **patterns**.
