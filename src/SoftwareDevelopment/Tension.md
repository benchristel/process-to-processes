What happens when {{link SoftwareDevelopment/Force forces}} pull us in conflicting directions?

</div>

We often find situations in software development where one force is pulling the system to develop in one direction, and another force is pulling it in the opposite direction. A common metaphor among software developers is to say that the competing needs or forces are in **tension**.

If the opposing forces cancel out perfectly, then the net effect on the system's development may be zeroâ€”no change. Even so, to someone inside the {{link SoftwareDevelopment/SoftwareSystem "software system"}}, the presence of equal opposing forces feels quite different from the absence of forces. Tension is stressful.

One way to view **software design** is that it gives us a way of breaking the gridlock between conflicting forces. Imagine busting the rust off a crank so it can turn freely. That's what good design feels like. A well-designed system arranges things so the forces that were previously butting heads can now slide easily past each other.
