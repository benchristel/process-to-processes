# View: Programming as Repair

If you talk to a therapist about the problems in your life, you might try to quantify their "productivity" by saying "well, they helped me with this problem and this problem and this problem, so that's three problems they fixed." But that's silly. What is happening in therapy is not that specific problems are getting "solved," but that you, as a whole person, are *healing*. Human problems tend to be more interrelated than not, and software is all about solving human problems. Our task as programmers is not to make *the software*, in isolation, "better" in some abstract sense, but to make *the whole human-software system* better for the humans in it.

There are ways to project quantifications onto the results of programming (e.g. counting the number of {{link Feature "Features"}} or {{link StoryPoints}} completed) but these quantifications are artificial. The more fundamental idea is that the system *as a whole* is *qualitatively* changed by every act of programming. This implies that every change to the program should improve *the whole* — see {{link Wholeness}}.
