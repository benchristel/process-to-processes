# View: Programming as Production

- The "More" frame: no code means no software, some code means some software. So more code must mean more software.

The production view of programming gets us from zero to oneâ€”from no software to *some* software. But it gives us a misleading view of what differentiates an effective programmer from an ineffective one. It beguiles us into thinking that we can measure programmer productivity by counting lines of code.
