# Programming

To drive home the {{link 36Views}} idea, let's explore a few views of something every programmer is familiar with: the task of programming itself.

By "programming," I mean the inner loop of software development, the thing which happens between you and the machine, and which is essentially the same whether you're working on a 100-line program alone or on a million-line codebase with a team. That is: **getting code to work**.

I find some of these views more useful than others. Still, each and every one of them has a purpose. Rest assured, there's a reason all these views of programming exist.

By looking at the interplay between these different views, we'll build a mental model of programming that will inform the subsequent chapters.
