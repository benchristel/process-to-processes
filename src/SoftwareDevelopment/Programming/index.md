# Programming

To drive home the {{link 36Views}} idea, let's explore a few views of something every programmer is familiar with: the task of programming itself.

I find some of these views more useful than others. Still, each and every one of them has a purpose. Rest assured, there's a reason all these views of programming exist.

By looking at the interplay between these different views, we'll build a mental model of programming that will inform the subsequent chapters.
