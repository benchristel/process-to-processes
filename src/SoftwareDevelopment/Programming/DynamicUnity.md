# View: The Dynamic Unity

The problems with the preceding views of programming flow from a common source: they assume that the programmer is the thinker, the doer, the unmoved mover, and that the program is inert, unintelligent matter that the programmer shapes as a potter shapes clay. They assume that cause and effect flow in one direction onlyâ€”from the programmer to the program.

I'm not going to say this assumption is _wrong_, because views aren't right or wrong, only helpful or unhelpful. So I'll just say: it's unhelpful. It doesn't help us make sense of what is going on when we're programming, and that should be reason enough to discard it.
