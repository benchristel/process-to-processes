# View: The Software System

There is a system of interacting people and computers that creates value for your employer. As a software engineer, your job is to improve this sociotechnical system so it nets more value.

Improving the system might mean writing code, but it might also mean:

- Reporting a bug
- Learning a new skill
- Teaching that new skill to someone else
- Configuring your development environment to make your work easier
- Rethinking how your team prioritizes and assigns tasks
- Studying the business domain you're working in
- Setting up a recurring meeting
- Canceling a meeting that's no longer useful

These are all examples of changes to {{link StructureAndBehavior structure}} that affect the system's {{link StructureAndBehavior behavior}}.

If {{link /Software.html software}} is structure that has behavior, then your organization _is_ software, though it runs on people instead of silicon. Its code is the policies, {{link Incentive}}s, habits, and communication pathways that shape its employees' behavior. If no one engineers that system to work well, then—surprise surprise—it will work poorly.

[Kent Beck notes that a software system is "people & computers together"](https://www.mechanical-orchard.com/post/features-and-design-why-not-both).
