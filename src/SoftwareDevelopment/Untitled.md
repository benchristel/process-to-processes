Software is the tool we use to improve software.

- software we buy (OSes, editors, deployment platforms) but also software we make (tests, one-off tools, dev UIs—all the components of a {{link MakingApp}}).

...and, more abstractly, structure is the tool we use to improve structure. The structure of the code, the way it's shaped, is our greatest assistance in understanding and changing that very structure to improve its behavior.

This might seem circular or at least counterintuitive, but I suspect that in ages past it would have been seen as obvious.

- How do you reach the roof of a wooden house to repair it? By building a ladder out of wood.
- How do you tie sheaves of grain for transport? With straw from the field where it was harvested.

Using materials you find onsite—that is, *using the site to change itself*—is simply pragmatic and efficient.

The art, the tools, the artist, and the audience are all part of a single continuum in which every part of the system acts upon every other part.
