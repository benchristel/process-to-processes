# Technique: Personal Projects

---

***...a way to experiment with different programming styles, and get in touch with your true feelings about them.***

One of the best things you can do to deepen and broaden your technical knowledge is to work on side projects, outside your day job.

A **personal project** is a {{link /SideProject.html "Side Project"}} where:

- You will frequently use the software yourself.
- You work on it alone.
- You are solely responsible for the code.
- You will maintain and improve the code over a long period of timeâ€”ideally years.
- No one else is going to see or care about how the code looks.

Personal projects have a twofold purpose: 

1. They give you a place to practice programming. A personal project is an environment where it's safe to make mistakes, and you can explore and experiment freely.
2. They put you in touch with how you really feel about different programming styles and techniques.

This second purpose is not often recognized. But it is vitally important.

Maintaining code that you wrote over a long period of time, where you have no one else to blame and no one to impress, really brings you face to face with your own true preferences. By working on my own projects, I have learned:

- A lot of the time pressure I feel at work is self-imposed. It comes from my own impatience, not from my manager or coworkers.
- The code I prefer to read often looks very different from the code I think I "should" write.
- When I begin a project aiming for "the perfect design", the result feels awkward and contorted, and I start to dread working on it.

This process of self-discovery is frustrating and humbling at first. But it leads ultimately to peace, because you eventually realize that when you are in touch with your feelings about the code, you can relax. Instead of tenaciously pursuing idealistic images of how things "should" be,
you can simply fix the problems that _really_ exist, and are _really_ important to you, one at a time. You'll be open to many more ways of doing things, and won't feel the need to put down anyone else's programming style,
because you'll see that everything is a good idea in its proper context.
