If you want to program a computer,
First, get a good night's sleep.
This is the hardest step, but it makes everything else easier.

Intelligence is a property of interactions,
not of people.
To make intelligence happen, you must be well-fed,
well-read, alert, and free from anxiety.
Your perception must be sharp, your awareness wide,
and you must have improved on what you are about to do at least six times.
Knowing better and doing better, day after day,
you discover you are the universe.

Be kind, humble, and egoless.
If you have to look foolish in order to get something done right,
look foolish.
This is the greatest form of intelligence.

Love your work and tend it as you would a garden.
If you don't, it will become your enemy.
Love your work as if it were yourself,
because it is.
The code is not the work.

Learning is the work.
Code is merely the husk of learning.
Cast off the husk and save the kernel.
Delete the code at your earliest convenience.
The knowledge lives on in the bending of the grass.

The wise see programming lessons everywhere:
In cooking, building, games...
They see everything as connected.
Ordinary programmers only learn from programming.
Fools don't learn no matter what they do.
If you can find lessons everywhere,
Every moment of your life will teach you something.
This is the path to deep knowledge.

Simplicity is the antidote to stupidity.
Therefore, shun complexity.
Delete all conditionals, loops, and variables,
all branching, iteration, and state
(except, of course, what you actually need.)
(You may find you don't need much.)

Divide and conquer
is the strategy of both the novice and the master
but their approaches are very different.

The novice begins by chopping the problem
first into large pieces, then finer and finer.
The pieces form a bewildering puzzle.
He hacks until his face is red and his knife is dull.

The master looks at the problem from every angle.
Then she simply lays the pieces side by side.
There seems to be no need to cut, no need for a knife.
The problem flakes apart like perfectly-cooked fish.
There is something eternal in the solution,
as if it had always been there.

I want to write code like <em>that</em>—
Code that resounds with one clear note.
It is an ideal, rarely attained.

If you are leading a tiger,
keep the leash tight.
Hold danger close—that way, you know where it is.
If you think danger is far off, but you're not sure,
Then you are truly in danger.

Toe the line between failure and success.
Know how to make your tests fail,
and how to make them pass again.
This is one way to keep the leash tight.
When you've mapped failure, you can find your way out of it.

If you want to find god,
look for an old waterwheel
standing by a river under the pines.
It turns, creaks, year after year,
because it is rough and sturdy
and because people care for it.
It isn't trying to be anything,
Yet it is useful and beloved.
So it goes on being.
