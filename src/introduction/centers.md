# Centers

[Your system](system.html)—like every sociotechnical system—can be modeled as a system of internally coherent, interrelated, fuzzily-bounded regions that I call _centers_.

The term _center_ comes from the architect-builder Christopher Alexander. He used it to refer to the visually coherent regions of space that appear in art and architecture, but we can use it to talk about more abstract things—software, teams, and companies.

A software application is a center. So are a person, a company, an office building, a team, a line of code, a function, a process, a meeting, and a meal.

Centers are cohesive and identifiable; you can name them, point to them, count them, and recognize ones you've seen before. However, centers do not necessarily have a precise boundary, so they may not be separable from their context.

The concept of a center may seem a bit hard to grasp. However, I am sure that you already have an intuitive and practical sense of the concept, though you may not be used to paying attention to centers or talking about them.

To see that you already understand what a center is, imagine a whirlpool in a stream.

What is a whirlpool? It's not a set of water molecules. The physical material that makes up the whirlpool is rapidly and constantly changing. It's also not an exact shape; the particular ripples in the water are constantly changing. It's not separable from the stream itself; you can't lift it out of the water and take it home with you.

Yet you can point to it. You can name it. If there are several whirlpools, you can count them. If you come back the next day and the whirlpool is still there, you can say "it's the same one I saw yesterday". If you know you can do all those things, then you know what a center is.

There are, of course, also centers that are more like "objects"—things that _can_ mostly be separated from their context, and that _do_ have a more or less consistent physical makeup. You are used to thinking and talking about these, so I won't dwell on them.
