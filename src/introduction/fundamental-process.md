# The Fundamental Process

The fundamental process for improving a [system](system.html) is a variant of the OODA loop (OODA = observe, orient, decide, act):

1. Observe the system, just as it is.
2. Notice something that could be better.
3. Make a small change to make that thing better without making anything else worse.
4. [Evaluate](feedback.html) the results. If your change made things worse, undo it.
5. Repeat.
