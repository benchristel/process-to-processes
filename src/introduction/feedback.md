# Feedback and Evaluation

In order to know whether a pattern applies to a situation you must have some way to know if the result of applying it is any good. There are two parts to this. The first, _feedback_, is the mechanism by which you sense the results. The second, _evaluation_, is how you know if the result is good. This book tells you how to get feedback and how to evaluate results.
