# The System

There is a system of interacting people and computers that creates value for your employer. As a software engineer, your job is to improve this sociotechnical system so it nets more value.

Improving the system might mean writing code, but it might also mean:

- Reporting a bug
- Learning a new skill
- Teaching that new skill to someone else
- Rethinking how your team prioritizes and assigns tasks
- Studying the business domain you're working in
- Scheduling a meeting
- Canceling a meeting

## Systems Are Grown, Not Made

Because money is limited and the future is uncertain, the system cannot be created, all at once. It must be _grown_, bit by bit, incorporating [feedback](feedback.html) from its environment at every step. A system that is designed and built all at once is almost certain to be as dead as a flower made from glued-together petals and leaves.

## Implications

The idea that a software engineer's job is to improve the system has some often-overlooked implications.

- 
- Improving the system involves reshaping both human-computer *and* human-human interactions.
- Code, viewed as instructions for a computer, is a) very cheap, and b) a poor proxy for value.
- A better proxy for value is the "intelligence" of the whole system: its ability to act effectively and to learn. Your own skills and learning abilities contribute to this, but the smartest organizations are smarter than the sum of their members.
