# The System

There is a system of interacting people and computers that creates value for your employer. As a software engineer, your job is to improve the system so it nets more value. A few subtleties are often overlooked:

- Because money is limited and the future is uncertain, the system cannot be created, all at once. It must be _grown_, bit by bit.
- Improving the system involves reshaping both human-computer *and* human-human interactions.
- Code, viewed as instructions for a computer, is a) very cheap, and b) a poor proxy for value.
- A better proxy for value is the "intelligence" of the whole system: its ability to act effectively and to learn. Your own skills and learning abilities contribute to this, but the smartest organizations are smarter than the sum of their members.
